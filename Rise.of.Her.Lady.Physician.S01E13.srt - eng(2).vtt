=Rong Zelan Is to Be Burned for Plague=

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.200
This is...

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.560
smallpox!

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.720
Zelan, I'm begging you!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.960
Please don't report it!

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.960
I'm just a third-class
medical attendant.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.920
If they find out about this,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.560
they will burn me to death!

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.760
Su Ye, get up first.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.040
Don't be afraid.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.840
I've had close contact with you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.320
and might get infected.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.440
Don't worry, I won't report it.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.480
Thank you, Zelan.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.280
Su Ye, think carefully.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.440
Recently, have you come into contact
with any unusual objects

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.760
or been to any obscure places?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.880
Before Yin left the palace,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.400
she gave me this porcelain bottle,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.480
saying it was precious.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.070
She also told me

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.040
to open it
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.200
However, when I opened it,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200
there was nothing

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.120
but some stinky stuff.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.920
I don't know what it is.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.720
(Did the smallpox)

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.240
(come from Feng Yin?)

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.160
(Did she deliberately release it)

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.680
(to take revenge on everyone?)

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.640
(Su Ye's situation is complicated.)

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.520
(If I report it,)

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.600
(they will burn her.)

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.440
(If I don't,)

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.840
(the plague might spread,)

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.800
(and more people could be infected.)

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.760
(What should I do?)

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.640
It's late.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.920
Attendant Rong,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.640
why do you look so troubled?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.680
Are you missing someone you like?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440
Lord Song, are you
wandering around at night

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.190
because you suffer from sleepwalking?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.160
That is certainly not true.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.520
Then why did you say
something so ridiculous?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.380
I...

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.440
Lord Song,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.840
I just caught a cold.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.840
It's better to keep our distance.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.440
We've known each other for a long time,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
and I've been working hard

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.920
to help you find the true culprit.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.280
I'm not taking credit.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.360
At least I should get some compliments.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.720
However,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.360
you're still treating me
so indifferently.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.800
I'm really upset.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.600
Attendant Rong,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.200
you don't have to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.480
be so distant with me.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.760
If your pity act were
a bit more sincere,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.360
I would've believed you.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.600
You haven't told me

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.000
what you were thinking.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.280
Lord Song.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.400
Assume that someone
is infected with a plague.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.680
Concealing it would cause
the disease to spread,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.280
whereas reporting it

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.920
will lead to the person's death.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
Should we save one's life

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.600
or protect the others?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.720
It's a dilemma.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.840
For the safety of the nation,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.450
we have no choice but

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.360
to choose the majority.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.600
But every life is precious.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.720
The best choice is to find a way

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.280
to save them all.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.160
Why do you have such a question?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.280
Lord Song, you're right.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.840
Saving the majority might be cruel,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.360
but it has to be done.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.080
Thanks, Lord Song.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.480
I've made up my mind.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.840
That's good.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800
If you need any help,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.360
just ask me.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.800
I'll always

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.240
be here.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.200
Su Ye.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.480
Don't scratch it!

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.680
I've told you

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.520
not to scratch it.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.650
Zelan.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.160
Do I have pimples on my face?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.480
Will I die in an ugly way?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.590
Don't be afraid.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.800
As long as you don't scratch it,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.480
you will neither get ugly nor die.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.440
Really?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.840
Rest assured.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.000
Zelan!

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.960
Stay away from me.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.120
I don't want you to get infected.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.720
I've taken protective measures,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.040
and I'll be careful.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.040
I had smallpox when I was a child

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.120
and won't have it again.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.880
Don't worry.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.660
Really?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.000
Have I ever lied to you?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.600
Right now, the most important thing

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.480
is to rest well and recover.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.800
Okay.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.380
(Wu Yunxiang, First-class Attendant)
Lord Feng,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.600
in order to protect Su Ye,
who got smallpox,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.040
Rong Zelan stayed
in the same room with her.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.600
Now they're

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.960
both in the most secluded wing room
in the backyard.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.240
They chose a good place.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.040
She's with Su Ye every day

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.040
and must've also got smallpox.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.560
That's exactly what I want.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.880
We'll have solid proof of
Rong Zelan's concealment

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
of the plague.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.720
And she'll be

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.800
burned to death.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.080
My Lord, you are farsighted.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.880
These days,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.720
keep a close eye on that room.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.040
If anything happens,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.160
report immediately.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.440
Rong Zelan.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.080
I'll let you live a few more days.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.240
Zelan,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.240
the pox on my face is almost healed.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.960
Zelan, what's wrong?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.720
I'm fine.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.280
Drink the medicine.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.760
Zelan!

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.840
Your neck...

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.000
You said you got smallpox once.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.640
You lied to me!

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.880
It's all my fault!

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.720
Don't worry.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.880
I cured you,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.960
so I can also cure...

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.040
But

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.520
you got infected because of me.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.920
It's all my fault!

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.360
It's okay, Su Ye.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.440
Trust me.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.300
Lord Feng,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.200
it's about time.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.920
Okay.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.160
Inform the others

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.000
that we discovered smallpox patients.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.360
To prevent the spread of the plague,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.080
we shall burn and bury
the patients immediately.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.200
Aye.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.040
The third drum exhausts the spirit.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.840
Rong Zelan.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.760
What are you doing?

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.160
By order of Lord Feng,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.080
we'll take you away to be burned.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.620
- Take them away!
- Aye!

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.380
What are you doing?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.250
- Get off me!
- Go!

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.720
- Go away!
- Get off me!

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.400
I heard

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.840
it was Su Ye and Rong Zelan
who got infected.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.880
Wh-What should we do?

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.680
We stay in the same room

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.740
with them.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.760
Could we also...

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.880
It's been days,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and we've seen no symptoms.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.960
We must be fine.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560
Don't let others hear this,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.920
or we'll be in trouble.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.400
Guards,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.720
light the fire.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.760
Lord Feng,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.200
shouldn't we investigate this thoroughly?

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.840
If they do not have smallpox,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.920
wouldn't that make us murderers?

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.400
Lord Wu.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.840
Their symptoms are so obvious.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.960
How could it be wrong?

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.080
Rong Zelan concealed the situation,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.120
which is a capital crime.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.680
As the minister
of the Imperial Medical Bureau,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.680
you failed to discover it in time.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.670
If the smallpox plague spreads,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.920
I'm afraid you can't afford

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.610
to be accused of negligence.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.880
However,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.720
if you don't believe it,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.840
you can verify it yourself.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.200
What do you think?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.960
The pulse is floating and rapid.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.000
It is indeed smallpox.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.480
Guards,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.520
light the fire!

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.280
Wait!

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.880
I have something to say.
