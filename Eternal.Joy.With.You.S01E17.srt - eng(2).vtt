00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.560
Hongmei, where is Chang'an?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.920
My Lady, I heard
about what happened last night

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.150
and came here at dawn.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.350
Young Master Chang'an is still sleeping.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.560
Then wait here for me.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.400
All right.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.070
Perfect timing.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.510
I have found a way to free your father.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.960
Really?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.590
I've discovered the Prefect's death
is connected to the Prince.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840
With that, we can clear your father's name.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.560
But we can't yet shake the Prince's power.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.910
We still need more evidence.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.520
Wanning.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.460
I...

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.700
I want to talk to you.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.020
It seems our thoughts are the same.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.340
Our marriage was decreed by the Emperor.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.370
It was the best makeshift solution.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.460
Have you ever asked about my feelings?

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.580
This is the gentleman's agreement I've made.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.500
From now on,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.820
this will be the home for you and Chang'an.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020
In this home,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.140
I will cherish

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.540
and respect you,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.820
and never force you to do anything
against your will.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.540
I only hope

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.820
you'll let me stay by your side.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.220
Wanning,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.700
I have feelings for you.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.740
It's not that I don't have feelings for you.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.940
Commander,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.300
you've done so much for me,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.780
and I know it well.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.700
But for now,
I can't think about such things.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.020
My father is still unjustly imprisoned.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.740
All I wish for is his safety.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.820
Still, rest assured.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.250
As long as you need me,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.620
I will always be by your side.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.740
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.580
Simply having you near

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.820
makes me happy.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.300
Then...

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.940
Would you like to freshen up a bit?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.140
Let's go bring your father home.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.780
Okay.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.620
Come on.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.300
Step aside. This is my wife.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.100
Father.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.340
We're here to take you home.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.060
I can go home?

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.580
They released me?

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.660
Yes.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.940
We've found proof

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.540
that you were framed

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.700
by the deceased prefect.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.700
Thank you, Commander Pei

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.250
for clearing my name
and proving my innocence.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.740
Please rise.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.580
Father,

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.060
he's your son-in-law.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.660
To clear your name,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.920
he spared no effort,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.820
worrying day and night.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.740
But this is also his duty.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.380
So, such formality isn't necessary.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.300
Son-in-law?

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.060
That can't be.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.100
Why not?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.500
Right, dear?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.140
I greet my father-in-law.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.540
You honor me.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.020
Father, let's go home.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.140
Rest well,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.740
and I'll explain everything later.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.590
All right.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.580
- Let's go.
- Please.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.340
Come on.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.780
I've sent my father home.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.260
He wanted you to stay for dinner.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.540
I have matters to attend to today.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.900
Let me send you back first.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.540
Thank you for today.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.220
How formal you've become.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.780
You weren't like this just now.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.380
I just worried Father would be concerned.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.980
Well,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.660
I wonder how you want to thank me.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.940
Stop it.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.660
How will you thank me?

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.730
I...

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.580
All right.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.620
I'm very pleased with this thanks.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.900
Stop smiling.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.180
Hmm.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.660
Aunt Ning, we've finished writing.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.340
(Xu Wanning, Pei Heng)

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.060
(Xu Wanning, Pei Heng)

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.620
What is this?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.340
Is this how I taught you?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.500
If you keep writing nonsense like this,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.580
I won't teach you anymore.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.980
Mother, we won't misbehave again.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.380
Please teach us.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.860
Aunt Ning, please don't be upset.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.550
We'll write properly.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.260
I don't believe you.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.380
Anyway, I'm done teaching you.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.300
I'm back.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.900
- You're back.
- Master.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.180
- Let me.
- Are you being good?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.380
How's the investigation?

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.580
Still going.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.500
Master, please appease Aunt Ning.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.300
She's angry with us.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.020
What happened?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.020
We didn't write properly.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.660
We'll do better next time.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.540
Please help us.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.420
Let me see what's written.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.500
Children's scribbling. No need to look.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.900
Go write now.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.740
Go.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.840
Right. I have a matter to discuss with you.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.300
Chang'an and Ruyi are of the right age.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.740
I think it's time for them to go to school.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.660
Indeed.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:08.860
Then,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.860
let's send them to the Baima Academy.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.820
All the capital's nobles

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.860
send their children there to study.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.540
We should send Chang'an and Ruyi as well.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.980
Baima Academy?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.060
That's excellent.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.820
Thank you for your help with this.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.220
I'll handle it right away.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.940
Right now?

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.780
Let me take a look.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.060
(Xu Wanning, Pei Heng)

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.580
Children's scribbling. What's there to see?

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.260
You must be hungry. Freshen up a bit.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.380
Time for dinner.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.820
I saw it.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.060
Tell me.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.940
Was that gentleman's agreement I made

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.220
rather pointless?

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.260
Don't take children's scribbling seriously.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Of course I take it seriously.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.580
We must commit fully to act properly, right?

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.220
Stop it. The children are watching.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.060
Come on.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.100
Practice well.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.060
Chang'an, what's wrong?

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.420
Nothing.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.380
Do you like this?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.060
Did you pack all your writing materials?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.200
Mm.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.300
Today is your first day at the academy.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.900
You must listen to the teacher

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.020
and treat your classmates well

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.020
with proper courtesy.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.860
Understand?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.760
Mm.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.160
Got it, Aunt Ning.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.340
Got it.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:39.780
(Academy)

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.980
Be careful.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.380
Mm.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.020
Go ahead.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.780
Bye-bye, Aunt Ning.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.740
Keep in heart what I said.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.860
Go on.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.700
Chang'an?

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.900
I took the children
to the academy this morning,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.260
but they haven't returned home
since dismissal.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.500
Don't worry. Let's look together.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.520
Master.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.420
Ruyi.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.140
Why didn't you come home after class?

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.020
Where's Chang'an?

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.020
Chang'an was mocked,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.740
so I got angry and wanted to fight them.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.810
But Chang'an wouldn't let me.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.650
Then he ran off to hide.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.580
Where is he?

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.460
Over there?

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.220
Come on.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.760
Chang'an, are you all right?

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.020
What happened?
Why didn't you come home?

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.300
Why did you get into a fight?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.700
Did they bully you?

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.380
I'm asking you.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.700
Speak.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.260
Mother, I don't want
to go to school anymore.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.940
Ruyi, what's going on?

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.660
The teacher asked Chang'an
to write about his father,

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.260
but Chang'an couldn't.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.780
So the others mocked him

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.990
and teased him.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.380
Chang'an,

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.980
I am your father.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.580
But I heard you say

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.260
that you are a fake couple.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.540
You are not my father.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.740
Listen.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.300
Your master and I...

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.940
Because of the decree,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.030
- we are now...
- Chang'an.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.700
You are my son.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.660
We just quarreled that day.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.900
Is that right?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.820
Yes, dear.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.740
We've already made up.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.140
You're lying! Have you really made up?

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.380
Why don't you show us?

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.700
Get up first.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.700
Do you believe now?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.700
All right.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.500
Now go home with your mother.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.580
I have something to take care of.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.540
What are you going to do?

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.340
Deal with those who bullied my son.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.580
Let's go.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.940
Happy now?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.340
Come on.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.980
I've invited you all today for tea

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.300
regarding my son Chang'an.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.300
He studies at Baima Academy.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.940
I've heard your children

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.660
attend as well.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.500
I hope they can establish good fellowship

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.420
as classmates.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.460
Lord Zhang,

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.300
I recall your son

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.540
called mine a street brat.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.700
Did you teach him that?

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.700
No, no.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.980
I wouldn't dare.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.620
Best not.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.820
Pour Lord Zhang more tea.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.820
So he can go home and teach his boy

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.540
how to treat his peers.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.700
Yes, yes.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.740
Of course.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.620
My son is ignorant.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.540
I'll have him properly disciplined

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.660
to make sure he gets along well

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.940
with Chang'an.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.260
I'm glad to hear it.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.300
Otherwise, next time,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.980
I'll handle it personally.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.580
I don't hold back.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:43.780
Yes, yes.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.740
Understood.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.180
Pei Heng!

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.260
This isn't over.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.300
Though we fear you,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.380
His Majesty

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.700
still keeps you in check.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.480
Mother.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.360
Aunt Ning.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.230
You're home.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.230
Wash your hands. It's time to eat.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.380
Chang'an looks very happy today.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.380
Getting along well with your classmates?

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.140
Father took care of everything.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.660
Chang'an.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.360
What?

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.500
Master said he is my father.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.820
That's not appropriate to say.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.460
By the way, Hongmei.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.380
Where is Commander Pei?

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.700
I saw Mohan with medicine today.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.540
It seems the Commander is injured.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.820
You take care of them.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.780
- Okay.
- Eat well.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.780
Mm.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.180
Lord Zhang is really too much.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.100
He joined others to accuse you
before His Majesty,

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.140
causing you to be punished.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.540
Clearly his son bullied Chang'an first.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.460
It doesn't matter. Just a scratch.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.180
As long as Chang'an can study in peace,

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.260
it's worth it.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.580
Does it hurt?

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.340
How come you're here?

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.820
Sit still. Let me apply the medicine for you
