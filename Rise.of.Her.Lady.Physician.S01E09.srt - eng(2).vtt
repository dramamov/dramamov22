00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.920
Zelan,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.880
you even cured
Her Highness's strange illness.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.240
Being demoted to the Ji'an Office
is only temporary.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.800
With your medical skills,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.920
perhaps you'll be summoned back soon
and entrusted with

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.000
important tasks.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.120
Su Ye, you must
take good care of yourself.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.760
If anything happens,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.200
go to the Ji'an Office and tell me.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.160
You've been demoted to the Ji'an Office,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720
and you're still pretending
to offer help.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.960
Exactly.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.080
You act like

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.200
you're the most capable
person in the world.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.440
Su Ye,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840
don't ever go near the Ji'an Office.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.320
That place is haunted.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.800
What?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.240
Feng Yin, don't scare me.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.720
I'm not lying.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.200
All corpses are stored there.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.520
I heard

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.120
you might hear the sound of fingernails
scratching the coffins at night.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.200
Attendant Li, who was demoted there,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.960
seems to have been driven insane.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.240
Yes.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.080
Later, she started to bite
anyone she saw,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.320
turning into a cannibal!

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.680
Attendant Rong,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.080
you must be careful.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.320
Don't let those resentful ghosts

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.340
steal your soul.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.730
Don't you feel a bit cold in here?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.840
Indeed.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.200
It's cold and damp.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.240
Not really.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.720
It's just getting dark.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.520
Oh, Attendant Rong!

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.000
Why are your hands so cold?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.240
Could it be that you're possessed?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.990
Attendant Li was also like this
before she left.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.280
Hot water can ward off evil.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.560
Sun Yu.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.960
Don't let the ghost possess her.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120
It's scalding hot!

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.160
Rong Zelan, are you crazy?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840
I never argue with fools.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.920
Hot water can not only ward off evil

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.680
but also scald the tongues
that spout nonsense.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.360
If I hear your crazy stories again,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.960
I'll make sure to use

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.960
Bone-Melting Water.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.200
And remember,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.720
ghosts may not claim lives,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.720
but the living can make you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.000
wish you were dead.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.960
What do you want to do?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.760
The Ji'an Office stores fresh corpses,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.360
keeps thirty percent
of our poisonous herbs,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.080
and refines lethal poison.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920
If you want to be a specimen,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.560
provoke me as you want.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.880
You...

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.320
By the way,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.680
when I splashed the water,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.160
I accidentally spilled some Itch Powder.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880
If you can't bear the sting tonight,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.920
come to the Ji'an Office
and beg me on your knees.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.600
Bye.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.360
(Rong Zelan,)

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.680
(I tried so hard to get rid of you.)

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.880
(I won't allow you to rise again!)

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.360
(Ji'an Office)

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.800
(is where your life will end!)

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.980
(Ji'an Office)

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.240
(It's okay.)

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.920
(It's just a bit shabby.)

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.840
(I must find a way to leave
as soon as possible.)

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.200
(I can't be trapped here forever.)

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.480
Sir,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.160
excuse me,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.760
are you the person in charge?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.440
Sir, where should I be staying?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.160
Where is he?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.880
He was here a moment ago.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.520
That elder walks quite fast.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.340
(Mourn)

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.400
Oh!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880
Stop screaming.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.500
Haven't you seen a corpse before?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.080
I thought he came back to life.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.880
Why didn't you say a word?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.800
Sir!

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.910
Come on, get up.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.960
Newcomer,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.200
move this corpse

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.320
into the coffin.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.200
Why is he so heavy?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.080
It hurts.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.320
Let me take a look.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.760
Luckily, no fracture.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.400
Why did you hit me?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.440
I'm not too old to have a girl

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.720
treat my injury.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.520
Now that I'm here,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.040
I won't be a burden.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.960
I'm Rong Zelan.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.950
Senior, feel free to order me

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.080
to do anything.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.920
Let me help you.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.160
Senior, where exactly am I staying?

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.120
Senior!

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.380
(Elder Zhong, Ji'an Office Steward)

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.560
(Stomach, Life Gate, Small Intestine)
This is

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.280
an anatomical diagram
specifically for ulcer treatment.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.520
Senior,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.720
you know how to treat ulcers?

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.720
Don't touch my stuff!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.040
(He's actually
a master of ulcer treatment.)

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.320
(If I learn the technique,)

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.080
(maybe it can help me
prove my mom's innocence.)

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.460
(Lateral Internal Diagram)

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.600
Senior,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.240
your skill in drawing diagrams

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.640
is probably unmatched by

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.800
everyone combined in the bureau.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.720
Stop flattering.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.760
I happen to know some medicine,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
and I'm really interested in
ulcer treatment.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.780
When I was little,
I studied a few relevant books

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.000
and even performed

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.960
dissections on mice and frogs
as instructed.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.520
But this field is so profound

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.640
that I still have
many unresolved doubts.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.780
May I

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.860
ask for your guidance, Senior?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.020
You're a mere woman, and you

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.410
want to be an ulcer doctor?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.160
You look delicate and weak.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.800
I'm afraid you might faint
at the sight of blood,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.430
let alone face those

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.790
filthy, rotten flesh all day.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.840
Can you endure such hardship?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.470
Of course...

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.170
To study medicine,
one must be righteous.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.240
Who knows what you're really up to?

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.630
Get out.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.480
Don't bother me!

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.600
But I...

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.890
Go to the empty room at the corner.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.200
Just leave me alone.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.760
Okay.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.400
Elder Zhong,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.990
(Zhou Wenxi, Medical Attendant)
The latrine in the yard is blocked again.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.230
Then clear it!

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.200
But it's just...

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.760
too dirty.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.920
Are you asking me to do it?

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.440
(I must make him
take me as his apprentice.)

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.840
Elder Zhong, I'll go.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.800
I'm not afraid of dirt.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.320
Elder Zhong,
the latrine has been cleared.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.320
You can use it now.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.960
To be an ulcer doctor,

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.520
it's not just about not fearing filth.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.920
Senior,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.880
you keep saying
women are too weak to endure hardship.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.120
But I've proven
that I can endure hardship

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.360
and don't fear filth.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.480
I really want to study ulcer treatment.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.080
Please give me a chance.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.240
Elder Zhong!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.560
(I won't give up easily.)

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.160
Elder Zhong, have you eaten?

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.400
Elder Zhong, you must be tired.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.480
Go away!

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.060
Elder Zhong.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.110
Have some tea.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.680
Elder Zhong.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.280
Elder Zhong, let me help you.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.240
Go away.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.440
Elder Zhong,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.160
I really want to learn.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.720
Okay.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.680
You want me to teach you
ulcer treatment, right?

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.320
Some extremely decayed

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.040
corpses just arrived at the morgue,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.200
and there's one coffin left empty.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.320
If you can sleep
in that coffin for one night,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.840
I'll agree to teach you.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.880
Okay, no problem.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.840
Don't regret it.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.120
I won't.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.560
Hope you can keep your word.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.600
Who is it?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.000
Who?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.280
(They're sealing me in the coffin.)

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.160
Who is it?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.640
(Looks like someone
wants to suffocate me.)

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.440
(I cannot die of suffocation here.)

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.720
(Who wants to kill me?)

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.520
Don't regret it.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.240
(Could it be Elder Zhong?)

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.360
Mom,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.360
I haven't

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.240
cleared your name.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.520
I cannot die here.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.760
I must live...
