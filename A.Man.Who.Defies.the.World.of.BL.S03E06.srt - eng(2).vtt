WEBVTT

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.255
The actor playing the love interest is here.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:13.825
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:15.235
- Right this way, please.
- Okay.

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:17.755
Oh.

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:20.155
This is the world of BL, alright.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.085
Of course, the love interest is also a guy.

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:26.915
Just looking at him from a distance...

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:28.875
he has that sparkling aura.

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.675
Just what you'd expect from the protagonist's love interest.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:33.015
Alright.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:35.445
Let me get a good look at his face.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:41.265
Huh?

00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:49.885
Huh?

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:52.145
Three years.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:53.625
Wait for me for three years.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:55.655
When I turn twenty, I'll say it again.

00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:57.395
I'll say I love you.

00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:58.855
I...

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:01.465
am not giving up on you.

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:03.585
So...

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:04.995
Um...

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:08.275
That's all I wanted to tell you.

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:10.705
Didn't you say...

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:12.995
you wouldn't show your face for three years?

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:16.235
Since then, let's see...

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:20.075
It hasn't even been three weeks.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:24.035
Hello.

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:26.595
Oh...

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:28.115
Hello.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:29.985
Um...

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:31.965
The director suddenly asked me to come.

00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:34.295
I see.

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:36.525
And also...

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:39.175
I saw that you were here as an extra.

00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:44.445
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:48.655
Are you okay?

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:50.115
Ah...

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:51.345
I don't think I can make it.

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:52.305
Ah...

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:53.175
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:53.675
Is there anything we can use?

00:01:58.465 --> 00:01:59.465
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:02.305
Director.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.085
I just contacted the hospital.

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:06.735
They said he has to get checked out today,
so he won't be back.

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:09.985
Looks like we'll have to cancel the shoot.

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:14.955
Hmm?

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:19.755
The shoot...

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:20.995
I guess it can't be helped.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:23.945
Yeah.

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.255
It's decided then.

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:36.605
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"
(Episode 6)

00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:38.775
VS

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:40.705
The Film Shoot

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:41.995
Arc

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:13.435
The main character has arrived.

00:04:19.275 --> 00:04:19.805
Huh?

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:20.795
No way.

00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:22.215
Is this me?

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:24.025
Isn't this...

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:28.205
exactly what a main character
in this world of BL looks like?

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:32.895
Um...

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:34.765
It really suits you.

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:36.245
It looks great on you.

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.105
That's impossible.

00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:39.495
It's true.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:44.935
And we're rolling.

00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:46.245
Camera is rolling.

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.105
And...

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:49.505
Action!

00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:52.045
Go faster!

00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:53.575
We're going to be late for class!

00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:54.855
Alright, alright.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:56.125
I get it.

00:04:58.235 --> 00:04:59.905
Too fast, too fast!

00:04:59.955 --> 00:05:01.205
You're the one who told me to go faster!

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.025
I told you it's dangerous!

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:06.235
Okay, cut!

00:05:07.885 --> 00:05:08.885
Let's go again.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:11.255
- Waving the branch like that looks a bit stiff. Try to be more natural.
- Sorry.

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.215
- Let's do that one more time.
- Understood.

00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:21.765
Here.

00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:23.725
Thanks.

00:05:25.315 --> 00:05:26.315
Oh...

00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:28.675
Yours is bigger.

00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:30.255
Huh?

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:32.205
Then you can have this one.

00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:37.945
Still...

00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:39.935
Yours is still bigger.

00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:40.955
What?

00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:44.005
Then just take it.

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:49.165
But...

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:50.815
I want to share it with you.

00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:53.355
Here.

00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:55.405
Thanks.

00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:08.635
So this is where you were.

00:06:09.675 --> 00:06:10.675
Ah...

00:06:13.075 --> 00:06:16.065
You've been acting a little strange lately.

00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:18.355
Is something bothering you?

00:06:22.645 --> 00:06:24.185
What's wrong?

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:25.945
You can't even tell me?

00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:29.945
What is it?

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:33.035
Aren't we friends?

00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:37.565
It's because we're friends...

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:39.525
that there are things I can't say.

00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:43.595
I don't want to...

00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:45.315
ruin what we have.

00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:46.685
Huh...

00:06:47.355 --> 00:06:48.355
Does that mean...

00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:51.975
I have to go.

00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:53.335
I have my part-time job.

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:54.435
Hey!

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:01.215
Alright, cut!

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:02.505
OK.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:10.115
That was great, you two.

00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:11.595
Yeah.

00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:16.385
Glad we got it in one take.

00:07:16.755 --> 00:07:18.325
Yeah.

00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:38.605
It's so beautiful.

00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:39.985
Yeah...

00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:42.225
Alright.

00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:46.485
Let's have a contest.
See who can hang on the longest without falling.

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:49.715
If I win...

00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:55.415
you have to grant me one wish, okay?

00:07:56.575 --> 00:07:57.575
A wish?

00:07:58.305 --> 00:07:59.305
Yep.

00:08:01.235 --> 00:08:02.235
Oh.

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:04.645
I win.

00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:05.905
Yeah.

00:08:08.085 --> 00:08:09.385
My wish is...

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:11.795
to always be...

00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:14.435
by your side like this.

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:19.765
I can't...

00:08:20.485 --> 00:08:22.485
lie about my feelings anymore.

00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:26.475
I'm in love with you.

00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:31.625
That's all I wanted to tell you.

00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:42.215
Wait.

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:48.725
I'm in love with you, too.

00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:09.275
Okay, and cut!

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:10.625
OK.

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:12.175
That was the last shot.

00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:15.875
- That's a wrap! Great work.
- Great work.

00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:19.825
- Great work.
- Great work.

00:09:29.045 --> 00:09:30.795
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:09:37.505 --> 00:09:39.015
You're really enjoying that.

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:40.005
Oh, yeah.

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:43.955
It tastes even better than usual.

00:09:45.525 --> 00:09:47.705
I guess this is what a drink
after a hard day's work tastes like.

00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:53.055
You know, acting...

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.655
is actually pretty fun.

00:09:56.505 --> 00:09:57.505
Oh?

00:09:58.915 --> 00:09:59.915
Although...

00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:01.655
for me...

00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:04.405
it wasn't exactly acting.

00:10:07.555 --> 00:10:08.785
I told you it's dangerous!

00:10:08.965 --> 00:10:10.165
Then just take it.

00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:20.215
Um...

00:10:22.285 --> 00:10:23.285
I...

00:10:24.515 --> 00:10:25.715
Long time no see.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:29.895
Kikuchi.

00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:33.395
Who's that...?

00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:41.965
Aren't you supposed to be abroad?

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.845
I came back for my university break.

00:10:49.355 --> 00:10:51.905
A scene like this...

00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:54.515
Could it be...?

00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:56.715
The legendary...

00:10:56.805 --> 00:10:58.965
love triangle?

00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:09.525
No way.

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:13.185
A love triangle centered on me has actually erupted...

00:11:13.275 --> 00:11:16.145
This is the biggest flag of my entire life.

00:11:17.365 --> 00:11:18.865
As far as triangles go, this is the best kind.

00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:29.635
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:36.905
Kikuchi.

00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:39.345
Aren't you supposed to be abroad?

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:41.865
I'm back for my university break.

00:11:48.155 --> 00:11:49.155
It looks like you two...

00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:51.075
have something important to talk about.

00:11:52.325 --> 00:11:53.325
Uh...

00:11:53.425 --> 00:11:54.425
No, it's not...

00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:58.435
Thanks for the drinks.

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:26.195
Why didn't you contact me when you got back?

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:27.645
Sorry.

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.105
I was going to...

00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:32.735
but I don't have your contact info.

00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:35.925
Well...

00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:37.275
I guess that's true.

00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:42.015
You know...

00:12:43.175 --> 00:12:45.905
Even when I was over there,
I was always thinking about you.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:47.975
Huh...?

00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:49.795
I wondered...

00:12:49.985 --> 00:12:51.325
what you were doing.

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:54.225
What was making you smile.

00:12:55.195 --> 00:12:56.735
I was always thinking about that.

00:13:03.565 --> 00:13:04.565
So, um...

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:07.275
Who was that guy from before?

00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:09.015
Oh.

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.025
He's a friend of my brother's.

00:13:11.895 --> 00:13:13.785
We were in a movie together.

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:18.395
It looked like he's into you.

00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:20.295
No way.

00:13:20.555 --> 00:13:22.075
There's no way that's true.

00:13:26.075 --> 00:13:27.955
Don't mind me.

00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:31.645
Kikuchi.

00:13:34.015 --> 00:13:36.045
This beer tastes extra bitter today.

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:38.885
I wonder why.

00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:10.915
Huh?

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:15.205
(Internal debate in session.)

00:14:16.395 --> 00:14:17.555
What should I do?

00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:20.595
What on earth am I going to do?

00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:24.505
It tastes better than usual.

00:14:26.335 --> 00:14:27.635
Today's beer...

00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:29.455
seems especially bitter.

00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:31.075
I wonder why.

00:14:38.175 --> 00:14:41.385
How do I dodge the biggest flag of my life?

00:14:42.365 --> 00:14:44.135
What am I supposed to do?

00:14:50.635 --> 00:14:52.365
VS

00:14:52.445 --> 00:14:54.785
Falling in Love

00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:56.145
Chapter

00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:05.785
Mmm, this is delicious.

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.155
Why are you always eating sweets?

00:15:11.055 --> 00:15:13.415
I brought them for you, big brother.

00:15:15.135 --> 00:15:17.755
You need sugar when you're thinking, right?

00:15:19.555 --> 00:15:20.555
Yeah.

00:15:21.865 --> 00:15:22.865
I guess so...

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:28.955
By the way, Ayato.

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:30.125
Hmm?

00:15:32.205 --> 00:15:34.575
How have things been with you and Tojo lately?

00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:39.655
Well...

00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:43.065
The other day...

00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:46.495
Ayato.

00:15:46.575 --> 00:15:47.875
Want to stop by somewhere on the way?

00:15:51.205 --> 00:15:52.205
Ayato?

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:54.915
Sometimes, I feel insecure.

00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:57.195
Why would Tojo...

00:15:57.845 --> 00:15:59.405
date someone like me?

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:07.625
Because Tojo is just too perfect, too brilliant.

00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:11.375
What's wrong?

00:16:11.965 --> 00:16:13.165
Oh... it's nothing.

00:16:13.235 --> 00:16:14.435
For someone like Tojo...

00:16:14.745 --> 00:16:15.945
it shouldn't be me.

00:16:17.335 --> 00:16:18.535
That guy...

00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:21.515
or that guy over there.

00:16:25.225 --> 00:16:27.215
There are so many other people

00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:29.205
who are a better match for him.

00:16:34.275 --> 00:16:35.275
Ah.

00:16:37.075 --> 00:16:38.275
Hey, Ayato.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:40.605
Want to check out this place?

00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:42.105
Looks like they have some amazing parfaits.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:43.785
Parfaits?

00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:47.885
Couples only...

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:51.565
Let's get this one.

00:16:52.085 --> 00:16:53.185
No, that's...

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:56.315
Don't get so flustered.

00:16:58.195 --> 00:16:59.395
I'm just kidding.

00:16:59.715 --> 00:17:00.915
After all...

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:03.615
After all...?

00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:05.875
Yeah.

00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:08.105
Because you, Ayato,

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:11.015
would be embarrassed if people around us

00:17:11.015 --> 00:17:12.385
knew we were a couple, right?

00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:19.625
Come on.

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:21.185
Let's go, Ayato.

00:17:29.855 --> 00:17:31.375
Let's go, Tojo.

00:17:32.405 --> 00:17:33.405
Huh?

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:35.875
I...

00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:39.275
have never once been embarrassed
about being your boyfriend.

00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:43.685
Ayato.

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:18.675
Geez, get a room.

00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:21.855
Hey, big brother.

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:24.835
Love...

00:18:25.695 --> 00:18:27.185
is a truly wonderful thing.

00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:30.735
Huh?

00:18:33.265 --> 00:18:34.765
So you too, big brother...

00:18:36.005 --> 00:18:37.355
Don't be afraid.

00:18:37.725 --> 00:18:39.235
Why don't you try falling in love?

00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:41.425
What?

00:18:42.885 --> 00:18:44.295
Fall in love.

00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:52.685
Fall in love?

00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:54.685
- Yeah.
- Me?

00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:56.125
Yeah.

00:18:59.435 --> 00:19:00.635
No way.

00:19:02.415 --> 00:19:03.415
Sigh...

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:20.885
Love...

00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:23.075
is a truly wonderful thing.

00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:27.725
Every single one of them...

00:19:27.965 --> 00:19:30.075
Why does everyone want me to fall in love?

00:19:30.925 --> 00:19:32.655
I'm a mob character.

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:34.665
Mob characters aren't supposed to fall in love. NG.

00:19:34.865 --> 00:19:36.725
I'm a mob character with walls of steel.

00:19:37.065 --> 00:19:38.295
No BL.

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.545
No Life.

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:43.185
Huh?

00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:47.405
Can you really escape?

00:19:49.275 --> 00:19:50.275
Look.

00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:51.805
Here it comes, here it comes...

00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:53.785
Ah.

00:19:58.835 --> 00:19:59.835
Ahh.

00:20:06.235 --> 00:20:07.305
I knew it... I still...

00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:10.385
can't give up on you.

00:20:10.565 --> 00:20:11.425
Huh...?

00:20:12.555 --> 00:20:13.985
We filmed a movie together.

00:20:14.585 --> 00:20:15.845
We were always together.

00:20:16.785 --> 00:20:18.175
And it made my feelings for you grow stronger.

00:20:22.015 --> 00:20:23.215
Huh?

00:20:24.455 --> 00:20:27.965
Will you accept my feelings?

00:20:28.815 --> 00:20:30.285
This is bad.

00:20:31.725 --> 00:20:32.995
The flowers of love...

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.645
are blooming everywhere.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.475
I knew it, I also...

00:20:39.555 --> 00:20:41.075
can't forget you.

00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:48.595
So, what will you do, mob character?

00:20:48.925 --> 00:20:49.925
This flag...

00:20:50.405 --> 00:20:52.675
How do you plan on dodging it?

00:20:54.405 --> 00:20:55.605
What do I do?

00:20:58.525 --> 00:20:59.805
What do I do?

00:21:06.525 --> 00:21:07.725
I...

00:21:14.455 --> 00:21:15.455
Oh!

00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:17.425
Wait, it's over already?

00:21:18.275 --> 00:21:19.805
To see what happens next, wait for the sequel!

00:21:20.035 --> 00:21:21.495
Then again, is there going to be a sequel?

00:21:23.065 --> 00:21:23.865
Ah!

00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:27.805
