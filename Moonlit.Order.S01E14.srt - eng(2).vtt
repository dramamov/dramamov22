Yes.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.131
He fell into the river

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.131
during a mission

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.931

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.770
(He got shattered)

00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:21.290
(when he fell into a river?)

00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:22.090
Yes.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.330
Died in line of duty.

00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:24.931
On the third floor of a tavern,

00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:26.530
a carriage struck him.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.811
Wait.

00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:29.650
T-Then he went swoosh...

00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:30.731
Swoosh...

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.571
Swoosh... Boom!

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:32.970
Yeah.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.931
Hailstones.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.371
Must've been hailstones.

00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:37.131
Then he went gurgle...

00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.410
Others went swoosh...

00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:39.051
And he...

00:07:46.178 --> 00:07:48.440
(Jing'an Bureau)

00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:54.371
(Gu Qianfu fears death so much)

00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:56.424
(that he adds goji berries to his wine.)

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.650
(How could such a man die on duty?)

00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:00.691
(Something is off.)

00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:03.171
(They must have caught Young Master.)

00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:13.896
(If I impersonate
the former Crown Prince,)

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.530
(Jing'an Bureau)
(my family)

00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:17.171

00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:37.011
What is it?

00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:39.528
Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.930
The one you're looking for

00:08:41.251 --> 00:08:41.890
is here.

00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:43.690
What?

00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:45.930
My beloved concubine

00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:47.251
who fled

00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:49.491
half a year ago is back?

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.851
(Xue Hexu?)

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:53.650
(Concubine?)

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.011
(Xue Hexu comes and goes,)

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.491
(seeking medicine)

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.690
(or stealing paintings)

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.371
(whenever he wants.)

00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:09.211
(Yet all my attempts to kill him)

00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.851
(have failed.)

00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:13.611
(He is truly cunning.)

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:18.890
You claim

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.251
to be the former Crown Prince

00:09:22.331 --> 00:09:23.690
hiding among the people.

00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:25.131
Indeed.

00:09:27.251 --> 00:09:28.091
Mr. Xue Hexu.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.050
Such claims can't be made lightly.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.770
When Hua Biliang
used bone-portrait identification,

00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.810
the result showed someone else.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.770
Do you possess face-changing skills?

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:42.851
(Oh no.)

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:43.690
(I forgot)

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.251
(about the bone-portrait.)

00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:48.770
Mother

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.211
was kind to Mr. Hua.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.091
He wouldn't betray me.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.930
So he fabricated that portrait.

00:09:58.131 --> 00:09:59.770
Your explanation

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.011
sounds plausible enough.

00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:05.091
But how can you prove

00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:07.091
your claim?

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.170
It's a long story.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.410
Back then,

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.371
to escape bandits' pursuit,

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.810
Mother took me and hid.

00:10:21.131 --> 00:10:21.731
However,

00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:23.890
the Emperor's men eventually found us

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.690
and killed her.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.251
Mother had been nice to Lord Dingyuan.

00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:32.211
So he helped me escape

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.410
and hid me

00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:34.530
at Xue Mansion,

00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:35.930
and claimed that

00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:37.451
I'm his second son.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.930
Over the years,

00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:44.331
he has suffered a lot,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.770
concealing the truth.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.731
Those assassination attempts

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.930
have even implicated
my brother Xue Dongyang.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.091
Once a brilliant child,

00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:55.491
he's now regressed
to childlike simplicity.

00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:57.890
The Xue family

00:10:58.371 --> 00:10:59.410
has protected me

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.331
and suffered attacks.

00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:03.491
After learning the truth,

00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:04.810
I had no choice but to

00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:07.091
pit Jing'an Bureau
against Xue Guardians.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.211
Then I set the Jing'an Bureau on fire

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.011
to escape.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.650
So the Jing'an Bureau fire

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.011
was your doing.

00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:16.690
It was your doing?

00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:18.451
That's not the point.

00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:19.331
The point is,

00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:20.570
hand me to the Emperor,

00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:22.371
and you defeat the Xue Guardians.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.011
It's not that I distrust you.

00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:30.211
It's just that

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.290
after years of hiding,

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.290
you suddenly showed up.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.251
It reeks of deception.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.570
I'd be exposed eventually.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.410
Better to come forth.

00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:46.050
If you remain skeptical,

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.170
I can negotiate
with Xue Guardians instead.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.131
State your terms.

00:11:56.251 --> 00:11:57.810
Keep my family safe.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.770
I could simply arrest you now

00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:03.650
and refuse your demands.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.290
You're a wise man.

00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:07.890
Protect my family,

00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:09.050
and they will

00:12:09.211 --> 00:12:11.050
become your loyal supporters.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.611
It's a good deal, no?

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.650
No wonder they say

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.810
that you have a cunning mind.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.570
Guards. Arrest him.

00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:38.451
You won't cheat death every time.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.650
Previously,

00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:43.890
I sent Broadsword Sect's leader
to kill you,

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:45.091
but you escaped.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.211
You won't get away today.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.451
(He was indeed the one)

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.530
(who hired assassins.)

00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:52.530
(Why does he want me dead?)

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.091
Liu Xiaodan, Broadsword Sect Leader,

00:12:55.731 --> 00:12:56.611
a skilled fighter.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.011
Our master entrusts you
with this vital task.

00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:01.251
Kill Lord Dingyuan's second son:

00:13:01.851 --> 00:13:02.690
Xue Hexu.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.451
(Feng Zuoren will surely
steal the painting.)

00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:24.890
(I'll turn their scheme against them.)

00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:05.570
Hua Biliang didn't lie to me.

00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:08.890
The bone-portrait identification
shows that

00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:12.011
the former Crown Prince is Xue Hexu.

00:14:13.371 --> 00:14:14.731
Clever me. I substituted

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.091
the portrait

00:14:17.451 --> 00:14:18.851
with Xue Youshou's image,

00:14:19.611 --> 00:14:22.410
fooling that Xue Guardian witch.

00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:25.930
(What?)

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.491
(Hua Biliang painted me,)

00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:30.170
(not Xue Youshou?)

00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:31.890
Xue Hexu,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.851
the world sees you as a failure

00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:38.890
like your idiot brother.

00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:41.251
But I thought about it.

00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:43.290
Lord Dingyuan intentionally

00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:46.251
kept you hidden at home,

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.451
guarding you secretly

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.011
to hide your true identity.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.770
You expect me to take credit?

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:57.770
But you have no idea

00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:00.211
my true target

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.211
isn't you.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:07.810
Kill him.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:09.650
As usual.

00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:11.050
Yes, Grand Tutor.

00:15:14.251 --> 00:15:15.770
(Why does he want to kill me)

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.211
(in secret?)

00:15:19.091 --> 00:15:21.251
(He should make this widely known)

00:15:21.451 --> 00:15:22.451
(and hand me over)

00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:23.890
(for Emperor Jia)

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.890
(to execute me.)

00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:28.371
(But he plans to execute me secretly.)

00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:30.690
(What is he plotting?)

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.050
Tell me what the Jing'an Bureau

00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:39.331
is working on in detail.

00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:40.488
Understood.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.371
Commander.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.131
They sent 13 men

00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:47.690
to capture Grand Tutor Zhou's

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:48.770
long-fled concubine.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.011
Two were sent to tail us
but got counter-tracked.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.690
They held

00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:53.810
a noon banquet at Chunhua Tower

00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:56.091
and repelled eight debt collectors.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.731
They discussed

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.890
Grand Tutor Zhou's illegal deeds

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.290
and cursed him 36 times.

00:16:01.331 --> 00:16:02.091
- And...
- Stop.

00:16:02.731 --> 00:16:03.491
Too detailed.

00:16:03.944 --> 00:16:04.744
Get to the point.

00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:05.890
There is a "point"?

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.851
Commander, I found Xue Youshou.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.170
Where? Take me there.

00:16:09.192 --> 00:16:09.650
Understood.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.971
I don't have a "point".

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.091
Commander, well...

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.451
Grand Tutor Zhou is secretly

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.451
executing Xue Hexu.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:16.971
What?

00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:17.930
Who?

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:19.890
G-Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.290
Executing whom?

00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:22.690
Xue Hexu.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.890
Where is he?

00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:26.011
Take me there.

00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:28.131
Suburban woods.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:29.971
This way.

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:38.371
Come on.

00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:38.890
Come on.

00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:39.848
- Why?
- Tie him up.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:41.290
Where are we?

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.331
You'll find out.

00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:43.930
Tie him up.

00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:44.570
Tighter.

00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:47.211
- It's okay.
- Who are you?

00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:47.810
Move.

00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:48.770
Let's go.

00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:54.251
Let's go.

00:16:58.611 --> 00:16:59.331
Kneel here.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.451
Kneel.

00:17:03.611 --> 00:17:04.090
Kneel.

00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:05.731
Don't move.

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:06.691
Come here.

00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:07.411
Sir.

00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:20.251
Kill him.

00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:21.931
As usual.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.130
Yes, sir.

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:26.491
Sir.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.610
Kill him.

00:17:29.171 --> 00:17:29.770
As usual.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.931
"As usual," how?

00:17:34.451 --> 00:17:35.570
They changed the rules.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.891
We must pay up front.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.370
So handsome.

00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:43.691
I have no money.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.770
I haven't been paid this month.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.850
Oh my god, you're so slow.

00:17:49.251 --> 00:17:51.411
This will take another hour.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.290
They're waiting to die.

00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:55.570
But they're so casual.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:56.691
What nonsense...

00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:58.130
In that case,

00:17:58.491 --> 00:17:59.011
how about

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.171
we handle this privately?

00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:03.251
We'll pocket the money.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.810
Idiot.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.370
Grand Tutor hired a killer to keep

00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.931
the Jing'an Bureau out of this.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.130
If you hire a killer

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:13.448
and get exposed,

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.810
I won't clean up after you.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:15.491
Pfft.

00:18:23.931 --> 00:18:24.610
My buddy.

00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:26.931
What?

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:27.770
Pay up.

00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:29.891
You got this.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.370
I'll be at Grand Tutor's mansion,

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.736
expecting good news.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.731
Who's your buddy?

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:53.931
Look how scared you are.

00:19:03.491 --> 00:19:04.731
It must have been overused

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.290
and broken.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.050
Make do with it.

00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:18.491
It must have been overused and broken.

00:19:21.011 --> 00:19:21.891
Make do with it.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.530
Never mind. It's getting late.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.050
Let's get it done.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.011
Let's start with the killing.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:44.850
It must have been overused

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:45.651
and broken.

00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:49.610
Make do with it...

00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:52.130
No worries.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.570
Make do with it.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:57.731
Is he an idiot?

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.570
(He doesn't look very bright.)

00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:04.451
(I may scare him off)

00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:05.491
(with my title.)

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.290
I'm the son

00:20:07.691 --> 00:20:08.891
of Lord Gong.

00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:09.530
You...

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.090
You can't kill me.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.130
Die.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.770
I hate when people drop names with me.

00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:22.011
(I paid Gu Qianfu)

00:20:22.011 --> 00:20:23.411
(to learn the Lingbo Steps.)

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.130
(Time to put it to use.)

00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:31.731
I'm the leader of the Xiaoyao Sect.

00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.330
You think you can trap me?

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.290
Lingbo

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.090
Steps!

00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:43.850
This old coot's hard to target.

00:20:44.171 --> 00:20:45.330
Still name-dropping here?

00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:46.610
What a mess.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:50.931
Your turn.

00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:11.610
(No way.)

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.610
(Xue Hexu, you cunning fox)

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.050
(will be fine.)

00:23:02.691 --> 00:23:03.931
How come it's you?

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.610
You planned this all along, huh?

00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:10.810
You impersonated
the former Crown Prince,

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.130
thinking I would be moved?

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.850
I hate self-righteous fools

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.011
who act on their own!
