EPISODE 1

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:54.535
IMPERIAL PRINT

00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:08.716
Last one to leave today too?

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.467
I just need to finish up two orders!

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:14.096
Did you take care of that reprint order?

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.558
-Yeah, they switched to rough-gloss paper.
-Good job!

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.396
-You're here!
-Hey there!

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.647
-Come on in!
-Come on, let's eat.

00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:26.150
-You're back!
-Come and eat.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:28.277
-Fried chicken!
-Hey, come over here!

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:33.490
-I gave you my heart, my love, my all
-My love, my all

00:01:33.574 --> 00:01:37.036
-But now you're leaving, like a stranger
-But now you're leaving, like a stranger

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.581
-Take the pain of goodbye with you
-Take the pain of goodbye with you

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.419
-You heartless one
-You heartless one

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:47.463
-Yes, fried chicken!
-Listen.

00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:51.216
What do you call a chicken
that's proud of itself?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.927
Come on, guess.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.720
It's pride chicken!

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:57.723
Right. Let's dig in.

00:01:57.806 --> 00:02:00.100
-Thanks for the food.
-Very funny.

00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:02.603
-Come on, pride chicken!
-Yeah, I heard you.

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:06.565
Man, I thought it was hilarious.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.108
-Let's eat.
-Jeez.

00:02:08.692 --> 00:02:10.319
Hey, hold on.

00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:13.280
This looks delicious.

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.158
Damn, it's gone cold.

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:22.247
When did you take that?

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:23.624
Let me explain, bro…

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:29.546
IMPERIAL PRINT

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.465
I got so much done today. Time to wrap up.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.677
This right here.

00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:37.388
Could you deliver this yourself?

00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:41.767
You don't want to go, do you?

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.894
Would you want to go if you were me?

00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:46.480
Well, it's Chae-bin's birthday today, so…

00:02:49.108 --> 00:02:52.194
Never mind, bro.
It's close, so I'll stop by on the way.

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:53.612
It's Chae-bin's birthday?

00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:57.408
-Forget it. Just go home.
-No, it's okay.

00:02:57.491 --> 00:02:59.702
It'd be awkward if you ran into Se-na.

00:03:00.452 --> 00:03:01.412
Look.

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:04.206
If I went like this,

00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:06.458
maybe she wouldn't recognize me.

00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:09.086
Do you really think
she wouldn't notice her ex in that?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.716
I wonder if she knows you live like this.

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:16.593
Will you really go yourself?

00:03:16.677 --> 00:03:18.721
Hurry up and leave
before I change my mind.

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:20.139
Thanks, bro. See you!

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:21.181
Hey!

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.280
THE QUEEN OF MELODRAMA

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:43.912
15 YEARS AGO

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:47.124
Please leave now.

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:48.792
I'd like to get off work.

00:03:50.294 --> 00:03:51.128
Mr. Hong.

00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:53.088
This is all a misunderstanding.

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:57.801
It's true we saw each other
while filming Sad Waltz,

00:03:57.885 --> 00:03:59.845
but we broke up a long time ago!

00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:05.100
If word gets out about this,
I'll have to step down

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:07.936
from all my commercials,
melodramas, and mini-series!

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.855
And I'd have to pay contract penalties!

00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:11.273
-Please…
-Listen.

00:04:11.774 --> 00:04:14.109
That's your problem, isn't it?

00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:16.612
And there's plenty of evidence
in front of you.

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:18.197
Don't be ridiculous.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.448
But this…

00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:25.329
Hyeon-jun was still hung up on me
and begged to see me one last time.

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:28.665
He said if I refused,
he'd come looking for me on set.

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.710
I had no choice but to see him.

00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:36.673
That's what happened, right?

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:39.927
Say something. Please?

00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:43.138
Please.

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:47.559
Don't do that.
You're making me uncomfortable.

00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:48.769
Please get up.

00:04:49.436 --> 00:04:50.896
Everything she said is true.

00:04:51.772 --> 00:04:52.689
I…

00:04:54.274 --> 00:04:55.776
I forced her into seeing me.

00:04:56.777 --> 00:04:57.694
Mr. Hong.

00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:01.365
Please don't publish that article.

00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:02.658
See?

00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.536
I told you there's nothing between us.

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:07.830
It's not fair for me.

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:08.872
Please, Mr. Hong.

00:05:30.644 --> 00:05:33.397
Why would hotshots like them
meet in a place like this?

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:04.094
Excuse me.

00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:05.179
Excuse me.

00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:18.233
Oh.

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:20.444
You're here, Ms. Wi.

00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:25.324
Why are you alone, sir?

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:26.825
Where's the assemblyman?

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.412
You're not on the level
to have a private meeting with him.

00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:34.875
Take a seat.

00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:53.602
I'll be in the US for eight months
filming the second season of Save Zone,

00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:55.771
so I'm not sure
if the timing will work out.

00:06:55.854 --> 00:06:58.190
Eight months will fly by
while we get ready for filming.

00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:00.484
If you agree to this role, Ms. Gwon,

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:02.861
I'd be willing to wait eight years,
let alone eight months.

00:07:05.697 --> 00:07:06.531
Yes?

00:07:06.615 --> 00:07:08.742
I'm here to drop off the script.

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:10.661
Oh, that was quick, Mr. Lim.

00:07:10.744 --> 00:07:12.454
Why is this so wet?

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:14.122
It's raining, so…

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:15.082
All right.

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:18.085
What's this?

00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:20.545
It's the script we had custom-printed.

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.798
I'll get going, then.

00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:23.715
Wait.

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:26.260
Thank you.

00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:31.390
I like it.

00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:33.183
You do?

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:35.352
It's a custom-printed special edition!

00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:39.439
Sir!

00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:46.405
Did Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan

00:07:47.197 --> 00:07:49.491
hire an aide
just to take the fall for him?

00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:51.994
Does Assemblyman Ha
really have nothing to do

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:54.079
with the redevelopment in Cheongwon City?

00:07:54.162 --> 00:07:57.207
Are you saying his aide
took all that money for himself?

00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.294
I know, right? The nerve of that guy.

00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:01.795
Mr. Woo Young-suk

00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:04.965
was supposed to meet me tomorrow.

00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:07.718
How could someone like that just die?

00:08:07.801 --> 00:08:09.136
We have breaking news.

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:11.471
This morning,
at a private parking lot in Seoul,

00:08:11.555 --> 00:08:13.640
Mr. Woo, an aide
to Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan,

00:08:13.724 --> 00:08:16.059
who was involved
in the redevelopment of Cheongwon City,

00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:17.477
was found dead.

00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:20.105
Charcoal briquettes and a note,
believed to be a suicide letter,

00:08:20.188 --> 00:08:22.607
were discovered at the scene.

00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:24.401
Ms. Wi, it seems you're upset

00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:26.945
because you missed out on an exclusive.

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:30.407
But these are the facts, all right?

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.036
I'm upset
because I missed out on an exclusive?

00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:38.623
Mr. Woo's family
wants to avoid escalating the issue.

00:08:38.707 --> 00:08:40.876
So if you keep poking around,

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:43.337
a lot of people will get hurt, understand?

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:45.172
Open it.

00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:51.595
A reporter needs to move fast.

00:08:53.555 --> 00:08:56.892
That should be enough to get a decent SUV.

00:08:58.226 --> 00:08:59.144
Take it.

00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:18.538
What are you doing?

00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:34.137
I learned a good lesson, thanks to you.

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:36.098
Think of the money as my lesson fee.

00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:48.068
Am I really this pathetic?

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.405
What was so embarrassing
that I even put on a cap?

00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:04.459
I thought it might be you,
and I was right.

00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:06.670
It's been a while.

00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:09.339
You haven't changed as much as I expected.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.803
You haven't changed either.

00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:19.182
Why did you come here?

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:22.352
You knew I'd be here,

00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:24.396
so you shouldn't have come.

00:10:25.522 --> 00:10:28.900
Did you show up looking like that,
hoping I'd feel guilty or something?

00:10:28.984 --> 00:10:30.444
-What?
-Or has life

00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:32.404
actually gotten that hard for you?

00:10:43.582 --> 00:10:45.250
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of that.

00:10:49.337 --> 00:10:50.172
Take care.

00:11:12.903 --> 00:11:14.988
You knew I'd be here,

00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:17.532
so you shouldn't have come.

00:11:24.998 --> 00:11:29.669
15 YEARS AGO

00:11:47.103 --> 00:11:48.063
Cut!

00:11:58.448 --> 00:11:59.533
Give it to me.

00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:05.247
I'll do it.

00:12:13.713 --> 00:12:15.006
Who are you?

00:12:16.675 --> 00:12:17.634
What the hell?

00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:18.969
-What's going on?
-You scared me.

00:12:19.052 --> 00:12:20.470
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

00:12:22.472 --> 00:12:24.599
Man, you scared me.
How did you even get in?

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:26.601
-My head is killing me.
-Goodness.

00:12:26.685 --> 00:12:29.521
-I think I'm being kidnapped.
-Kidnapped?

00:12:29.604 --> 00:12:31.773
-My location is…
-I'm not kidnapping you!

00:12:31.856 --> 00:12:35.110
-Don't open the door!
-I think we're crossing a bridge.

00:12:35.193 --> 00:12:37.529
What bridge are we on right now?

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:39.656
It's the Yeongdong Bridge!

00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:41.074
I'm on the Yeongdong Bridge!

00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:45.370
-Please come to the Yeongdong Bridge!
-Is she insane?

00:12:45.996 --> 00:12:47.789
Where are you taking me in this junky car?

00:12:47.872 --> 00:12:49.457
A RELIABLE POLICE FORCE, A SAFE NATION

00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:52.002
Since there's been
a misunderstanding between you two,

00:12:52.085 --> 00:12:53.420
and you came in voluntarily,

00:12:53.503 --> 00:12:56.131
we'll review the dashcam footage
to confirm what happened.

00:12:58.133 --> 00:12:59.050
Please take a look.

00:13:11.855 --> 00:13:12.856
Unbelievable.

00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:15.817
That's the footage from the front.

00:13:16.985 --> 00:13:18.153
Here's the next one.

00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:21.364
Come on, seriously?

00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:25.076
See? Look at that.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.288
We saw that she got in my car by herself,
so I'm innocent.

00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:29.205
Let's keep watching.

00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:32.959
Maybe he pretended not to notice
there was someone in the back.

00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:36.421
Wow, are you serious?

00:13:38.048 --> 00:13:40.300
Go ahead and play it.

00:13:40.383 --> 00:13:41.301
All right.

00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:44.429
That bitch.

00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:48.933
"You shouldn't have come"?

00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:52.687
-Hold on, I wasn't calling you a bitch.
-Seriously, who does she think she is?

00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:54.189
-Look.
-I can't believe she said that.

00:13:54.814 --> 00:13:56.650
As if she hasn't changed one bit.

00:13:56.733 --> 00:14:00.153
Her face is all sagging now,
with wrinkles around her eyes.

00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:05.450
And how is her acting
still as bad as before?

00:14:06.201 --> 00:14:08.411
She hasn't improved one bit.

00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:09.954
No progress at all.

00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:15.669
It's always the same long straight hair
and the same lousy acting.

00:14:15.752 --> 00:14:18.713
Man, I'm sick of it!

00:14:18.797 --> 00:14:20.882
I'm so sick of it!

00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:23.551
Who are you?

00:14:29.307 --> 00:14:30.600
-The thing is…
-It seems

00:14:30.684 --> 00:14:33.645
you were very angry at the time.

00:14:33.728 --> 00:14:36.731
Well, that settles things
between you two, right?

00:14:39.526 --> 00:14:40.485
I…

00:14:42.612 --> 00:14:44.698
I'm really sorry.

00:14:46.116 --> 00:14:47.158
Fine, then.

00:14:48.785 --> 00:14:50.829
Accusing an innocent person of kidnapping…

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.914
Unbelievable.

00:14:53.748 --> 00:14:54.833
I know, right?

00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:57.877
I got an innocent man killed

00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:00.380
and turned another into a kidnapper.

00:15:03.842 --> 00:15:05.427
What's the matter with me?

00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:08.513
Well…

00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:10.849
I'm such an idiot!

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:17.981
Officer, please just arrest me.
I deserve to get arrested.

00:15:18.064 --> 00:15:20.442
Who knows what other stupid mess
I'll get myself into?

00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:21.776
Just arrest me instead.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.362
Please throw me in jail!

00:15:24.446 --> 00:15:27.490
I'm begging you to throw me in jail.

00:15:27.574 --> 00:15:30.535
She sure is a mess when she's drunk.

00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:33.079
-I'm free to go now, right?
-Yes.

00:15:36.624 --> 00:15:37.751
-Take care, Officer.
-Goodbye.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.131
Just hurry up and put me in jail already.

00:16:09.574 --> 00:16:11.034
Drink that and sober up before you go.

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:13.620
And don't hop into
someone else's car again.

00:16:15.288 --> 00:16:17.999
It's a scary world out there, you know.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.044
You're lucky you got in my car.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.839
Thank you.

00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:31.304
You're obviously an average office worker.

00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:34.432
I don't know what made you drink so much,

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:39.062
but it's oftentimes not your fault
when something bad happens.

00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:41.731
So stop blaming yourself

00:16:41.815 --> 00:16:43.233
and keep moving on.

00:16:43.942 --> 00:16:45.026
You need to be successful…

00:16:46.194 --> 00:16:48.196
Has life actually gotten
that hard for you?

00:16:50.406 --> 00:16:51.991
Or else, people will look down on you.

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:56.412
Hold on a minute.

00:17:01.334 --> 00:17:03.670
THANK YOU
EUNSEONGILBO

00:17:05.964 --> 00:17:08.466
If you ever need my help,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.426
will you give me a call?

00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:22.689
Fine, then.

00:17:23.273 --> 00:17:24.732
Don't look at me like that.

00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:26.818
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.405
I'll be off, then.

00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:41.184
Mr. Woo Young-suk was
supposed to meet me tomorrow.

00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:44.020
How could someone like that just die?

00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:11.464
GWON SE-NA NAMED MUSE FOR LUXURY BRAND

00:19:13.633 --> 00:19:15.593
GWON SE-NA'S SAVE ZONE IS A GLOBAL HIT

00:19:37.407 --> 00:19:38.491
Hello.

00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:40.493
Yes?

00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:43.705
I had a script printed here a while ago,

00:19:43.788 --> 00:19:47.166
and there's a bit of an issue.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.086
An issue?

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.796
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:19:53.464 --> 00:19:55.008
Oh, this one.

00:19:56.384 --> 00:19:58.511
I believe Mr. Hwang took care of this.

00:19:58.594 --> 00:20:02.390
He said it was an independent film
for a graduation project

00:20:02.473 --> 00:20:05.309
and did it at cost price
without leaving any profit.

00:20:05.393 --> 00:20:08.730
Yes, he was very considerate
and offered me a discount on the printing

00:20:08.813 --> 00:20:10.690
and got it done
despite the tight deadline.

00:20:10.773 --> 00:20:12.066
He also accommodated

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.985
over ten revision requests
for the cover design.

00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:15.236
I'm very grateful.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.529
Right.

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:18.531
Mr. Hwang really went
out of his way to help you.

00:20:18.614 --> 00:20:19.532
He really did.

00:20:19.615 --> 00:20:21.617
But gratitude is one thing,
and this is business.

00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:25.246
I can't overlook mistakes
just because I appreciate his help.

00:20:27.206 --> 00:20:29.584
I'm sure you can overlook them
if you're truly grateful.

00:20:29.667 --> 00:20:31.794
But this is my first feature film,

00:20:31.878 --> 00:20:34.338
so I'm afraid I can't just let this slide.

00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:43.973
Go ahead and show me
where the mistakes are.

00:20:45.683 --> 00:20:48.853
The best boy electric's name
is Na Yun-seon,

00:20:48.936 --> 00:20:51.230
but it was printed as "Na Un-seon."

00:20:51.314 --> 00:20:53.983
And the cover has a strong reddish hue,

00:20:54.067 --> 00:20:56.903
but I was hoping for a softer vibe.

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:00.031
Overall, it lacks symmetry.

00:21:00.114 --> 00:21:02.492
There's a 2 mm difference
between the left and right margins.

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:04.577
And I asked Hamchorong Batang
Extended Bold for the font,

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.038
but he just went with
Hamchorong Batang Extended.

00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:09.707
Could you change it to
Hamchorong Batang Extended Bold instead?

00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:15.296
-Is that all?
-Yes.

00:21:16.714 --> 00:21:18.257
Didn't you say you're on a tight deadline?

00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:22.053
Yes, so I need to ask you
to get this done by tomorrow.

00:21:23.763 --> 00:21:25.515
That place over there is amazing.

00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:29.727
No, him.

00:21:32.313 --> 00:21:33.606
It wasn't me.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.400
He needed it in
Hamchorong Batang Extended Bold.

00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:38.277
Bold.

00:21:42.115 --> 00:21:43.324
Go on.

00:21:47.161 --> 00:21:48.955
He's worse than those TV station guys.

00:21:49.038 --> 00:21:50.665
I thought you were
going to punch him, bro.

00:21:50.748 --> 00:21:53.126
That's why I sent him away quickly.

00:21:53.209 --> 00:21:54.377
It was a close call.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.294
Good call.

00:21:55.378 --> 00:21:57.088
If you punch guys like him,
all you get is a sore fist.

00:22:01.509 --> 00:22:02.343
Oh, damn.

00:22:04.178 --> 00:22:05.513
Why is that Hamchorong guy still here?

00:22:06.889 --> 00:22:09.600
-Something's off about him.
-Why is he doing this to us?

00:22:09.684 --> 00:22:10.852
Should I ward him off?

00:22:10.935 --> 00:22:13.646
-He's so weird.
-Seriously.

00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:15.398
I know I've seen him before.

00:22:17.108 --> 00:22:18.818
"Good Detective Kang Pil-gu"?

00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:22.196
What kind of title is that?
His name’s just as weird.

00:22:37.378 --> 00:22:39.922
Wow, this punk…

00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:43.092
He's a genius.

00:22:57.899 --> 00:22:59.609
Damn it! What the hell?

00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:04.447
Could you change it to
Hamchorong Batang Extended Bold instead?

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.742
Hamchorong?
Have you lost your mind, you punk?

00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:09.202
You nearly gave me a heart attack!

00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:10.870
I remember now.

00:23:13.122 --> 00:23:14.123
What do you mean?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.251
I knew I'd seen you before.

00:23:17.335 --> 00:23:19.295
But I couldn't remember
even when I got home,

00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:22.298
or even after I walked my dog
and took out the recyclables.

00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:23.633
I was about to lose my damn mind.

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:25.760
But as soon as I lay down to sleep,

00:23:26.385 --> 00:23:27.220
I remembered.

00:23:28.512 --> 00:23:29.931
That movie, Sad Waltz.

00:23:30.598 --> 00:23:32.099
You're an actor!

00:23:33.643 --> 00:23:36.145
You came all the way back here
just to confirm that?

00:23:36.229 --> 00:23:37.188
No.

00:23:37.897 --> 00:23:38.981
I'm here to cast you.

00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:42.777
Jeez.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.322
I want you to be in my movie,
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

00:23:46.405 --> 00:23:49.367
as the main character,
Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:24:00.878 --> 00:24:01.879
Let's go.

00:24:01.963 --> 00:24:02.922
Damn!

00:24:05.174 --> 00:24:06.092
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:24:07.551 --> 00:24:08.719
Hurry, let's go.

00:24:12.098 --> 00:24:14.642
Hey, move! We're busy.

00:24:14.725 --> 00:24:15.685
Come on.

00:24:15.768 --> 00:24:17.645
Move it! We're busy!

00:24:18.271 --> 00:24:20.481
You're saying the color bled?

00:24:21.107 --> 00:24:22.316
And I told him…

00:24:24.026 --> 00:24:25.278
Hello there!

00:24:25.861 --> 00:24:27.863
We'll get it reprinted for you.

00:24:27.947 --> 00:24:29.282
Yes, of course.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.083
What the hell, man?

00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:41.335
Mr. Leading Man,
are you just getting off work?

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:43.087
Come on, seriously?

00:24:43.713 --> 00:24:44.880
What are you doing here?

00:24:44.964 --> 00:24:47.091
-Go home already!
-I'll go after you take this.

00:24:47.174 --> 00:24:48.467
Why are you here? Go away!

00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:50.970
Mr. Leading Man,
would you please just consider…

00:24:51.053 --> 00:24:52.722
I told you no already. Go away!

00:24:52.805 --> 00:24:53.931
You didn't have to lock the door.

00:24:54.015 --> 00:24:57.560
-There's no point in staying here. Go!
-Just help me out this once.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.062
Mr. Leading Man.

00:25:01.397 --> 00:25:02.481
Seriously?

00:25:02.565 --> 00:25:04.650
-I'm about to lose it.
-Mr. Leading Man?

00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:06.235
No, stop calling me that!

00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:07.737
Don't call me that, all right?

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.656
Mr. Lim, I really want you in my movie.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.367
You go to a great school.

00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:15.619
There must be a truckload of good actors
to choose from.

00:25:15.703 --> 00:25:17.621
What makes you think
you can trust me with that role?

00:25:17.705 --> 00:25:21.542
I get that it's just a graduation project,
but you can't afford to fail.

00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:23.210
I'm doing this
to make sure it's a success.

00:25:24.879 --> 00:25:25.880
Fine.

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:28.924
Let me ask you then.

00:25:29.008 --> 00:25:31.886
Why do you want me
to play that aggressive detective?

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.804
Because you'll do a great job!

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.475
I'm not good at explaining things,
but that's why.

00:25:37.558 --> 00:25:39.268
I can make it happen.

00:25:39.352 --> 00:25:41.979
I'm confident that I can,
if you'll just let me.

00:25:43.314 --> 00:25:45.775
I saw that there's
a ton of chase and fight scenes.

00:25:45.858 --> 00:25:47.485
I can't even fight!

00:25:47.568 --> 00:25:50.946
Pacifism runs in my DNA,
right down to the bone.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.198
I'm busy, so go away.

00:25:52.281 --> 00:25:53.324
Go away now!

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.078
Wait, you can't just throw that around!

00:25:57.161 --> 00:25:58.371
Please handle it with care.

00:25:58.954 --> 00:26:01.040
Goodness, Mr. Hwang. Don't drink too much.

00:26:01.123 --> 00:26:03.334
Yes, thank you.

00:26:07.129 --> 00:26:09.590
Come on, just do it.

00:26:10.174 --> 00:26:12.009
Why are you being so difficult?

00:26:12.093 --> 00:26:15.262
How many people would actually watch
an indie film made by a college student?

00:26:15.346 --> 00:26:16.347
-For goodness' sake.
-Well,

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.184
what if someone watches it
and I end up being humiliated?

00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:24.438
And why bother
if nobody's going to watch it anyway?

00:26:27.358 --> 00:26:29.068
You know, I read the script too.

00:26:31.195 --> 00:26:32.696
A story like that is rare to come by.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.783
Look, forget the fact
that the director is inexperienced.

00:26:35.866 --> 00:26:38.369
It's the kind of story that makes you
want to get right onto the set.

00:26:38.452 --> 00:26:40.371
Tell me, is it not?

00:26:42.164 --> 00:26:44.500
-It is.
-See?

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.092
Hey, remember when I was doing stage plays
and got recruited by the agency?

00:26:53.843 --> 00:26:55.261
You were my first manager.

00:26:55.344 --> 00:26:56.387
Right.

00:26:56.971 --> 00:26:58.264
How was I back then?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.474
You, bro?

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.977
You were…

00:27:03.477 --> 00:27:04.478
different.

00:27:07.731 --> 00:27:09.775
You had the potential to be a top star.

00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:10.776
Yeah, right.

00:27:15.156 --> 00:27:17.283
If only you hadn't dated Gwon Se-na,

00:27:17.867 --> 00:27:20.077
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:27:20.828 --> 00:27:24.832
That ungrateful little wench.

00:27:24.915 --> 00:27:29.003
You broke up with her for her sake,
and she should be thankful for that.

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:31.213
Instead, she lied just to save face.

00:27:33.716 --> 00:27:35.384
What's with that look?

00:27:35.468 --> 00:27:38.262
Don't tell me you think
this indie film could suddenly turn you

00:27:38.345 --> 00:27:41.182
into a world-famous movie star
or something.

00:27:41.682 --> 00:27:42.766
I never said I was thinking that!

00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:45.895
-Jeez, whatever.
-Why would you say that?

00:27:45.978 --> 00:27:47.646
No need to get so angry.

00:27:50.774 --> 00:27:51.734
Hey.

00:27:51.817 --> 00:27:55.237
We started this print shop
with our bare hands

00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:56.489
and made a name for ourselves.

00:27:56.572 --> 00:27:57.781
Things are pretty good now, no?

00:27:58.574 --> 00:28:00.618
Some people don't make
half as much as you do,

00:28:00.701 --> 00:28:02.953
but they still buy cars,
play golf, and live it up.

00:28:03.037 --> 00:28:04.705
But what do you do for yourself?

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:09.460
Just think of it as a hobby.

00:28:09.543 --> 00:28:13.088
You deserve to do what you want
every now and then.

00:28:13.881 --> 00:28:16.258
Don't worry
about the print shop, all right?

00:28:16.342 --> 00:28:17.384
Leave it to me.

00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:19.512
Imperial Print!

00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:38.948
MR. LEADING MAN,
I'LL ASK YOU ONE LAST TIME.

00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:41.909
PLEASE BE IN MY MOVIE.
IF YOU TURN ME DOWN AGAIN, I'LL STOP.

00:28:41.992 --> 00:28:44.703
BUT I URGE THAT YOU CONSIDER IT
WITH A POSITIVE MINDSET.

00:28:58.008 --> 00:28:59.969
Will I get paid?

00:29:05.432 --> 00:29:08.686
"He spins the handcuffs
and swiftly fastens them onto X's wrists."

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:13.399
"They say you can't fix people."

00:29:14.483 --> 00:29:15.401
"But…

00:29:16.485 --> 00:29:17.778
I do."

00:29:18.445 --> 00:29:21.740
"Then he collapses, sprawling next to X."

00:29:22.491 --> 00:29:25.119
All right,
we'll wrap up our table read here.

00:29:26.287 --> 00:29:27.162
Good job.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.081
Good work, everyone.

00:29:34.753 --> 00:29:37.006
Can I have a word with you?

00:29:37.631 --> 00:29:38.549
Sure.

00:29:59.987 --> 00:30:02.448
I overdid it earlier, didn't I?

00:30:06.452 --> 00:30:08.329
-Mr. Lim.
-Yes?

00:30:08.412 --> 00:30:11.248
Let me start by saying
that what I'm about to tell you

00:30:11.332 --> 00:30:14.209
is meant for the sake of the movie,
and not to teach or lecture you.

00:30:14.293 --> 00:30:17.171
Of course. Feel free to say whatever.

00:30:17.254 --> 00:30:19.840
Don't be shy. Just tell me.

00:30:19.923 --> 00:30:20.966
Before I do that,

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.344
I think we should decide on
how to address each other

00:30:23.427 --> 00:30:25.429
as a sign of respect
for our respective roles.

00:30:25.512 --> 00:30:27.139
Right. I see.

00:30:28.349 --> 00:30:29.183
Okay.

00:30:30.476 --> 00:30:32.061
You're right. Sounds good.

00:30:33.771 --> 00:30:34.938
Sounds good, Director.

00:30:36.982 --> 00:30:38.150
Mr. Lim.

00:30:38.233 --> 00:30:40.778
How did you analyze the character?

00:30:41.862 --> 00:30:43.155
Well…

00:30:43.238 --> 00:30:46.116
He thinks violence
is the only way to deal with criminals.

00:30:47.576 --> 00:30:50.621
And I think he has a troublemaker streak.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.707
Sir.

00:30:55.125 --> 00:30:58.545
How do you feel about him
fighting violence with violence?

00:30:59.588 --> 00:31:02.966
Wouldn't it depend
on the level of violence?

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.094
On a case-by-case basis, no?

00:31:05.177 --> 00:31:06.804
So his approach depends on the situation?

00:31:10.265 --> 00:31:12.267
You're right. It shows in your acting.

00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:15.312
It screams,
"I don't know if I'm doing this right,

00:31:15.396 --> 00:31:19.274
but I'm trying to make the punching
and beating as natural as possible."

00:31:19.358 --> 00:31:22.236
This character values his fists
over the law. Why?

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:25.197
Because his beliefs were
shaped by childhood experiences.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.701
That's why this character feels no guilt
beating up bad guys.

00:31:28.784 --> 00:31:30.536
To make this character authentic,

00:31:30.619 --> 00:31:32.830
you have to fully trust
that your beliefs are right.

00:31:32.913 --> 00:31:35.332
You have to become one with the character.

00:31:41.296 --> 00:31:42.423
Yes, sir.

00:31:42.506 --> 00:31:44.925
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:31:46.176 --> 00:31:47.261
Bro, what are you doing?

00:31:48.387 --> 00:31:50.013
We're swamped right now.

00:31:50.097 --> 00:31:51.890
-Hurry up and drop off the orders.
-Okay.

00:31:56.937 --> 00:31:58.856
They say you can't fix people.

00:31:58.939 --> 00:32:00.524
But I do.

00:32:00.607 --> 00:32:01.525
But I do.

00:32:01.608 --> 00:32:03.610
But I do!

00:32:03.694 --> 00:32:04.611
But I do!

00:32:07.698 --> 00:32:08.532
Stop right there!

00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:11.952
But I do.

00:32:29.344 --> 00:32:30.345
Stop right there!

00:32:31.722 --> 00:32:32.556
Stop.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.476
Stop!

00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:37.311
Stop right there!

00:32:50.282 --> 00:32:51.116
Cut!

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.872
Has he lost his damn mind?

00:32:58.332 --> 00:33:00.584
Who shoots a chase scene for three days?

00:33:04.087 --> 00:33:05.172
Two and a half days, actually.

00:33:06.048 --> 00:33:09.259
The only expression captured on camera
is total exhaustion.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.890
Maybe it's because Kang Pil-gu
is damn exhausted.

00:33:15.432 --> 00:33:16.266
Right, sir?

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:17.601
Wrong. Sure, it's hard.

00:33:17.684 --> 00:33:20.187
But he has to show he's determined
to catch the bastard

00:33:20.687 --> 00:33:22.105
and beat the hell out of him.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.191
Let's go again.

00:33:32.574 --> 00:33:35.077
Ready. Action!

00:33:37.663 --> 00:33:38.789
Cut!

00:33:38.872 --> 00:33:39.706
Action!

00:33:41.124 --> 00:33:42.668
Cut!

00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:43.585
Action!

00:33:47.965 --> 00:33:48.882
You okay?

00:33:50.217 --> 00:33:51.176
Don't stop.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.804
Keep acting until I say cut.

00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:01.436
All right, let's go again.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.396
Ready!

00:34:03.188 --> 00:34:04.189
Action!

00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:12.948
Cut.

00:34:18.412 --> 00:34:19.872
Mr. Lim, let's go again.

00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:24.376
That bastard.

00:34:28.088 --> 00:34:29.339
Ready. Action!

00:34:32.342 --> 00:34:35.220
-What?
-Cut.

00:34:35.304 --> 00:34:36.388
Damn it.

00:34:40.642 --> 00:34:42.436
-You did great.
-Thank you.

00:34:51.904 --> 00:34:53.488
Let's call it a day for the shoot.

00:34:57.743 --> 00:34:59.077
But we're not done yet.

00:35:00.287 --> 00:35:02.539
It seems you didn't fully prepare
for the character,

00:35:02.623 --> 00:35:06.710
so we'll stop filming today
and reshoot this later.

00:35:07.669 --> 00:35:08.837
-Clear the set, please.
-But…

00:35:08.921 --> 00:35:10.672
Hey, hold on a second!

00:35:11.548 --> 00:35:13.967
Are you out of your mind, Director?

00:35:14.051 --> 00:35:16.511
This isn't some multi-billion-won
budget movie!

00:35:16.595 --> 00:35:19.765
It's an indie film, so shoot it like one!

00:35:19.848 --> 00:35:21.516
Why can't you be reasonable about this?

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.061
Why can't you read the room
or know your limits?

00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:26.146
Are you taking this
to the Cannes Film Festival?

00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:28.231
Not even Bong Joon-ho
or Park Chan-wook would go this far!

00:35:29.733 --> 00:35:30.734
How would you know that?

00:35:30.817 --> 00:35:34.863
It's not like you've worked with
those directors either, Mr. Lim.

00:35:34.947 --> 00:35:36.531
What did you just say?

00:35:36.615 --> 00:35:38.158
Get over here!

00:35:38.241 --> 00:35:40.619
Why you little…

00:35:40.702 --> 00:35:43.372
I've been speaking to you respectfully
and showing you respect as the director!

00:35:43.455 --> 00:35:45.874
You were practically begging me
to be in your movie,

00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:48.377
so I agreed
to be in your movie without pay!

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.087
So how dare you say that to me?

00:35:50.754 --> 00:35:52.506
Had I known you were so bad at acting,

00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:54.716
I wouldn't have persuaded you.

00:35:57.636 --> 00:35:58.720
Is that so?

00:35:58.804 --> 00:36:01.223
So you have a death wish, is that it?

00:36:02.307 --> 00:36:04.851
Let's see how well you do on your own.

00:36:04.935 --> 00:36:06.228
I'm out!

00:36:14.027 --> 00:36:15.445
Cut. Again.

00:36:17.948 --> 00:36:19.574
-What?
-Cut. Again.

00:36:19.658 --> 00:36:21.702
Moving on to the next shot. Ready!

00:36:22.577 --> 00:36:23.495
Action!

00:36:25.539 --> 00:36:26.790
-What?
-Cut!

00:36:26.873 --> 00:36:28.458
All right. Ready.

00:36:29.084 --> 00:36:30.043
Action!

00:36:33.672 --> 00:36:34.756
What?

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.508
It's all your fault, Detective Kang!

00:36:36.591 --> 00:36:37.467
Let's go again!

00:36:37.551 --> 00:36:39.177
Damn it, not again!

00:37:03.577 --> 00:37:04.411
You punk!

00:37:36.818 --> 00:37:38.904
They say you can't fix people.

00:37:40.906 --> 00:37:41.782
But…

00:37:45.118 --> 00:37:46.369
I do.

00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:52.751
Cut! Okay!

00:37:52.834 --> 00:37:54.544
-We're done!
-Yes!

00:37:54.628 --> 00:37:57.464
And that's a wrap
for Good Detective Kang Pil-gu!

00:37:57.547 --> 00:37:59.299
Good work, everyone!

00:38:07.307 --> 00:38:09.351
Everyone, please fill your glass.

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:14.898
Thank you for all your hard work
while filming Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:38:14.981 --> 00:38:17.150
Make sure to fill your bellies today!

00:38:19.402 --> 00:38:21.154
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:38:21.238 --> 00:38:23.949
-Cheers.
-Drink up!

00:38:24.032 --> 00:38:25.158
Drink…

00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:31.373
It's finally over.

00:38:31.957 --> 00:38:32.833
Mr. Lim.

00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:37.254
I know that I gave you
a really hard time while filming.

00:38:37.337 --> 00:38:39.256
It's all my fault.

00:38:39.339 --> 00:38:41.925
I know you're probably upset with me,

00:38:42.008 --> 00:38:45.887
but I hope you'll accept this drink
and forget about it.

00:38:47.389 --> 00:38:48.640
Hey.

00:38:59.693 --> 00:39:00.569
Drink up.

00:39:00.652 --> 00:39:02.737
Big applause for our leading man!

00:39:04.781 --> 00:39:07.576
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:11.371
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:39:11.454 --> 00:39:14.791
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:19.004
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:39:22.465 --> 00:39:23.592
I'll have a drink.

00:39:36.813 --> 00:39:37.731
I hope…

00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:42.569
we never see each other again,
you little shit!

00:39:43.695 --> 00:39:46.740
And the Best Actor award
goes to Lim Hyeon-jun

00:39:46.823 --> 00:39:48.909
from Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:39:48.992 --> 00:39:52.329
We'll now hear
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun's acceptance speech.

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:59.044
By some miracle,
I've been given a second chance…

00:40:00.754 --> 00:40:02.005
and I won't let it slip away.

00:40:03.548 --> 00:40:04.674
From now on,

00:40:05.425 --> 00:40:08.470
I hope to act for a long time
alongside all of you…

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:16.478
in a way that will be remembered.

00:40:16.561 --> 00:40:17.437
Thank you!

00:40:18.855 --> 00:40:21.441
My life took a dramatic turn.

00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:23.109
Thank you!

00:40:23.193 --> 00:40:24.277
I'll do my very best.

00:40:24.361 --> 00:40:25.403
Thank you!

00:40:25.487 --> 00:40:26.488
Thank you.

00:40:28.323 --> 00:40:30.867
My black-and-white, documentary-like life

00:40:30.951 --> 00:40:34.537
turned into a romantic comedy
bursting with color.

00:40:35.038 --> 00:40:36.623

#1 MAN FANS WANT TO SEE AGAIN: KANG PIL-GU

00:40:51.096 --> 00:40:52.472
RETURNING IN SEASON 4
OF GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:40:52.555 --> 00:40:54.641
JUST HOW FAR WILL IT GO?
HIGHEST RATINGS: 28.5%

00:41:12.492 --> 00:41:13.702
What the hell?

00:41:13.785 --> 00:41:15.078
Are you taking this out?

00:41:15.578 --> 00:41:18.707
I just started it up
to keep the battery from dying out.

00:41:19.499 --> 00:41:20.583
I mean,

00:41:20.667 --> 00:41:24.254
I paid for this car myself,
so why can't I use it whenever I want?

00:41:24.337 --> 00:41:27.173
Come on, everyone's watching you.

00:41:27.966 --> 00:41:30.427
Take the company car
if you have a work appointment.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:34.889
I need to play roles like a wealthy heir,
a successful lawyer, or a doctor.

00:41:34.973 --> 00:41:38.310
That way, I won't look so out of place
driving a fancy car like that.

00:41:38.393 --> 00:41:41.229
I'm always playing broke detectives.

00:41:41.313 --> 00:41:44.107
No wonder people are shocked
when they see me in a car like that!

00:41:44.649 --> 00:41:46.776
People don't see the real me anymore.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.528
All they see is Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:41:48.611 --> 00:41:51.031
These days, I even mistake my own name
for Kang Pil-gu

00:41:51.656 --> 00:41:53.074
instead of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:41:53.158 --> 00:41:54.534
All right, I get it.

00:41:54.617 --> 00:41:57.912
Let's make sure your next project
reshapes your public image, bro.

00:41:58.705 --> 00:42:01.666
Let's please make that happen, Mr. Hwang.

00:42:03.043 --> 00:42:05.670
And don't call me "bro" in public.

00:42:07.172 --> 00:42:10.008
But why? You are my big bro.

00:42:10.091 --> 00:42:13.011
If you call me bro, it makes me look old.

00:42:13.094 --> 00:42:15.388
Shouldn't a CEO like you
manage his actor's public image?

00:42:15.972 --> 00:42:16.931
Seriously?

00:42:17.015 --> 00:42:18.892
What about my public image, then?

00:42:22.479 --> 00:42:24.481
Damn.

00:42:24.564 --> 00:42:26.608
You have a great body.

00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:29.152
Come to my room. I'll tip you really well.

00:42:29.235 --> 00:42:31.404
You pretty little thing.

00:42:33.073 --> 00:42:34.783
-Hands off.
-What?

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.534
Get lost.

00:42:38.703 --> 00:42:41.206
Man, what's the matter with her?

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.796
Her name is Wi Jeong-sin,
and she's 36 years old.

00:42:47.879 --> 00:42:49.881
She's been with Eunseongilbo for 12 years.

00:42:49.964 --> 00:42:52.133
She's currently
the political desk's ace reporter.

00:42:53.718 --> 00:42:56.471
She entered and graduated top of her class
in Media and Communication.

00:42:56.554 --> 00:42:58.556
She speaks English, Chinese, and Arabic

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.141
and is fluent in all four languages.

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:02.602
Known for her incredible mental toughness,

00:43:02.685 --> 00:43:05.146
she discovered crucial evidence
before the police

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.482
at a murder scene
involving a dismembered body

00:43:07.565 --> 00:43:10.527
that made even a 20-year veteran detective
vomit and pass out.

00:43:11.027 --> 00:43:14.155
She also climbed a 100-meter tower crane
to interview protestors

00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:16.533
and played a key role in getting

00:43:16.616 --> 00:43:18.827
all unfairly dismissed
construction workers reinstated.

00:43:21.913 --> 00:43:23.748
As a war correspondent,

00:43:23.832 --> 00:43:27.168
she was the first in the world to report
the horrors of the Serian Civil War.

00:43:36.886 --> 00:43:39.264
After being caught in a bomb blast

00:43:39.347 --> 00:43:42.016
that nearly led
to the amputation of her leg,

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.726
she had major surgery and barely survived.

00:43:45.645 --> 00:43:48.898
And she became the youngest recipient of
the Korean Journalist of the Year award.

00:43:48.982 --> 00:43:51.568
The Korean Journalist of the Year award
goes to Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

00:43:54.112 --> 00:43:56.489
KOREAN JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR
AWARD CEREMONY

00:43:56.573 --> 00:43:59.284
ONNURI JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION

00:44:02.579 --> 00:44:04.164
KOREAN JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR AWARD
WI JEONG-SIN

00:44:04.247 --> 00:44:05.081
DESK CHIEF
YUN HWA-YEONG

00:44:05.165 --> 00:44:07.584
-Did you write up this report?
-Yes.

00:44:08.209 --> 00:44:09.919
It's like a martial arts novel.
How is this real?

00:44:10.003 --> 00:44:11.379
I don't believe it all, either.

00:44:12.755 --> 00:44:15.049
But why come to the entertainment desk
at a sister paper

00:44:15.133 --> 00:44:17.927
instead of the culture desk
at the main paper?

00:44:18.011 --> 00:44:19.095
Isn't it obvious?

00:44:19.971 --> 00:44:21.264
They wanted her gone.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.477
Let's have a meeting.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.978
-Now?
-Pardon?

00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:30.732
See you later.

00:44:35.987 --> 00:44:37.697
Your new hair color looks amazing.

00:44:38.364 --> 00:44:39.782
Where did you get it done?

00:44:39.866 --> 00:44:41.701
A hair salon at Cheongdam Intersection.

00:44:42.285 --> 00:44:43.286
Are you new here?

00:44:44.787 --> 00:44:45.830
No.

00:44:46.664 --> 00:44:48.625
-Are you Bahn Soo-jung?
-Yes.

00:44:50.543 --> 00:44:52.420
-How do you know me?
-You have a video, right?

00:44:52.504 --> 00:44:56.591
On Friday, February 20th,
you went to entertain some VIPs

00:44:56.674 --> 00:44:58.927
and took a video on your phone,
hoping it might pay off.

00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:02.597
-Who are you?
-Me?

00:45:03.932 --> 00:45:04.891
I'm a reporter.

00:45:06.935 --> 00:45:07.894
Hey, Chief.

00:45:09.437 --> 00:45:10.605
I got a scoop.

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:17.362
We hit 28%!

00:45:17.445 --> 00:45:21.533
Our ratings were close to 30%
over the course

00:45:21.616 --> 00:45:23.493
of four whole seasons!

00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:25.870
I said 30%!

00:45:25.954 --> 00:45:30.083
Thanks to Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,
my production company bought a building!

00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:33.378
The TV stations said
making dramas wasn't profitable,

00:45:33.461 --> 00:45:36.422
so they almost shut down
that entire business.

00:45:36.506 --> 00:45:40.051
You can say that Kang Pil-gu
brought us back from the brink.

00:45:40.134 --> 00:45:41.386
This might sound funny coming from me,

00:45:41.469 --> 00:45:43.221
but Kang Pil-gu saved a lot of lives.

00:45:43.304 --> 00:45:44.389
Exactly!

00:45:44.472 --> 00:45:47.267
That's why we need
dramas like this to continue.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.811
Remember that old drama, Country Diaries?

00:45:49.894 --> 00:45:52.814
This drama needs to go on
for 10 to 20 years as well!

00:45:52.897 --> 00:45:56.192
Look at American dramas,
like CSI and NCSI.

00:45:56.276 --> 00:45:59.696
They have spin-offs based in Las Vegas,
Miami, and New York!

00:45:59.779 --> 00:46:03.950
Add them all up, and you can't even count
how many seasons there are!

00:46:04.033 --> 00:46:07.620
What's to stop Kang Pil-gu from running
for 10 or even 20 seasons?

00:46:07.704 --> 00:46:09.205
You're absolutely right.

00:46:09.289 --> 00:46:13.209
But all of that depends on
what our leading man decides to do.

00:46:24.095 --> 00:46:27.098
Are you saying
I have to play a detective until I die?

00:46:27.181 --> 00:46:31.144
Even Gil Grissom
from CSI: Vegas left the series

00:46:31.227 --> 00:46:32.687
to try something different!

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.023
There's nothing left in my life

00:46:35.106 --> 00:46:37.191
except for Kang Pil-gu!

00:46:37.275 --> 00:46:38.109
I'm done!

00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:48.745
I mean, of course…

00:46:50.455 --> 00:46:51.831
I'd love to do it.

00:46:51.914 --> 00:46:53.916
-Right?
-I knew it.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.835
Kang Pil-gu forever!

00:46:55.918 --> 00:46:58.504
It's much better to play Kang Pil-gu

00:46:58.588 --> 00:47:01.174
than to be in an iffy rom-com
that only gets 2% ratings.

00:47:01.257 --> 00:47:02.133
Of course.

00:47:03.885 --> 00:47:05.553
-That's much better.
-Exactly.

00:47:06.679 --> 00:47:08.181
But you know,

00:47:08.806 --> 00:47:11.893
-I've been a bit scared these days.
-What?

00:47:11.976 --> 00:47:13.895
If I want to last long as an actor,

00:47:13.978 --> 00:47:15.938
I'm afraid my role as Kang Pil-gu

00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:21.736
-must end here--
-That's because your acting is so good!

00:47:21.819 --> 00:47:24.656
Like those mistresses
you see in soap operas.

00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:27.617
Those actresses get slapped on the back
and cursed at by people on the street.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.035
It's like a badge of honor.

00:47:29.118 --> 00:47:31.120
-Of course, it is.
-Hello?

00:47:31.204 --> 00:47:32.830
Hello?

00:47:32.914 --> 00:47:35.041
Yes, of course. Excuse me.

00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:37.043
Right.

00:47:37.627 --> 00:47:39.337
Yes.

00:47:39.962 --> 00:47:41.047
Oh, I see.

00:47:49.305 --> 00:47:50.848
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

00:47:50.932 --> 00:47:52.266
The restroom is over there.

00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:54.394
Over there? Thank you.

00:48:06.948 --> 00:48:08.908
Why is the lock broken?

00:48:25.341 --> 00:48:26.217
Darn.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.929
What if Mr. Lim
absolutely refuses to do it?

00:48:30.012 --> 00:48:32.223
All he'll get right now
are iffy supporting roles.

00:48:32.306 --> 00:48:35.184
Who will give him a role
in a melodrama or rom-com at his age?

00:48:35.268 --> 00:48:36.352
He's stuck with Kang Pil-gu.

00:48:36.436 --> 00:48:39.272
I think he's trying to
negotiate a higher pay.

00:48:39.355 --> 00:48:41.190
So just play along for a bit.

00:48:53.953 --> 00:48:56.205
What? A reporter snuck in?

00:48:56.831 --> 00:48:58.458
What do you mean, a reporter came in?

00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:00.752
Were you not monitoring the guests?

00:49:01.753 --> 00:49:02.628
Wait, excuse me!

00:49:05.006 --> 00:49:05.882
-Hey!
-Hey!

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.040
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry!

00:49:39.123 --> 00:49:40.500
I'll leave soon. Just be quiet.

00:49:40.583 --> 00:49:42.418
-This is the men's--
-Be quiet!

00:49:45.713 --> 00:49:46.672
What's going on?

00:49:48.257 --> 00:49:50.802
I'm really sorry,
but I'm going to have to step on you.

00:49:53.679 --> 00:49:55.056
My leg! Watch my neck!

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.561
My neck!

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:10.279
My shoes!

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.698
Hurry up! Give me my shoes!

00:50:12.782 --> 00:50:13.866
-Here.
-I'm sorry.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.993
I'll cover the cost for your phone.
Call me at 0259-2151.

00:50:16.077 --> 00:50:17.537
Give me a call. I'm really sorry!

00:50:18.037 --> 00:50:19.413
My phone?

00:50:21.082 --> 00:50:22.708
My phone!

00:50:22.792 --> 00:50:23.876
Are you kidding me?

00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:27.129
Seriously?

00:50:29.298 --> 00:50:30.633
Damn it!

00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:39.392
There's a crazy woman here.

00:50:39.475 --> 00:50:42.311
Some crazy woman
came into the restroom and…

00:50:43.104 --> 00:50:44.063
Is she a stalker?

00:50:44.146 --> 00:50:47.191
Anyway, I just got attacked!

00:50:47.275 --> 00:50:48.943
I had an upset stomach
and went to the restroom.

00:50:49.026 --> 00:50:50.736
She came in all of a sudden,
stepped all over me,

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.029
and then disappeared…

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:54.782
And my phone fell in the toilet--

00:50:54.866 --> 00:50:55.992
You're Kang Pil-gu!

00:50:56.075 --> 00:50:57.618
You're Good Detective Kang Pil-gu, right?

00:51:00.705 --> 00:51:03.332
Who knew I'd see you here, Detective?
It's such an honor!

00:51:03.416 --> 00:51:05.459
I watched every single season.

00:51:06.711 --> 00:51:07.879
Thank you.

00:51:08.796 --> 00:51:09.964
So did someone barge into the restroom?

00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:14.218
No, don't worry about it.

00:51:15.219 --> 00:51:16.304
Go Kang Pil-gu!

00:51:24.478 --> 00:51:26.814
All he'll get right now
are iffy supporting roles.

00:51:26.898 --> 00:51:29.984
Who will give him a role
in a melodrama or rom-com at his age?

00:51:30.067 --> 00:51:31.527
He's stuck with Kang Pil-gu.

00:51:40.661 --> 00:51:42.914
What is it? Are you in a bad mood again?

00:51:42.997 --> 00:51:45.499
I wouldn't have gone there
if I'd known what it was about.

00:51:45.583 --> 00:51:46.959
A private hostess bar, no less.

00:51:47.043 --> 00:51:49.879
I know. That's why I didn't tell you.

00:51:49.962 --> 00:51:50.880
Mr. Hwang.

00:51:52.089 --> 00:51:56.135
I mean it when I say
that I won't play Kang Pil-gu anymore.

00:51:56.636 --> 00:51:59.639
Okay, I got it.
We'll talk about that later.

00:51:59.722 --> 00:52:01.390
Will you be okay at the award ceremony?

00:52:01.474 --> 00:52:04.435
I can tell you're worried,
taking those herbal calming pills.

00:52:05.603 --> 00:52:08.356
Do I have to go to the award ceremony?

00:52:08.439 --> 00:52:09.607
I'm not even getting one.

00:52:13.027 --> 00:52:17.740
You received an award last year,
so now it's your turn to give one.

00:52:17.823 --> 00:52:19.241
I'm sick right now.

00:52:20.576 --> 00:52:22.870
Come on, I'm in pain.

00:52:22.954 --> 00:52:25.456
Fine. Take some more pills.

00:52:35.174 --> 00:52:37.385
Blown away

00:52:38.678 --> 00:52:40.179
In the wind--

00:52:57.446 --> 00:52:58.864
OBTAINED HOSTESS ENTERTAINMENT VIDEO

00:52:58.948 --> 00:53:00.324
NO CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

00:53:10.126 --> 00:53:11.210
WOO YOUNG-SUK, AIDE

00:53:12.628 --> 00:53:14.338
Does Assemblyman Ha
really have nothing to do

00:53:14.422 --> 00:53:16.257
with the redevelopment in Cheongwon City?

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:19.385
Are you saying his aide
took all that money for himself?

00:53:19.468 --> 00:53:21.512
Mr. Woo, an aide
to Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan,

00:53:21.595 --> 00:53:22.805
was found dead.

00:53:22.888 --> 00:53:24.890
Officials are considering
the possibility of suicide.

00:53:24.974 --> 00:53:28.019
Mr. Woo's family
wants to avoid escalating the issue.

00:53:28.102 --> 00:53:29.854
So if you keep poking around,

00:53:29.937 --> 00:53:32.940
a lot of people will get hurt, understand?

00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:58.591
WOO YOUNG-SUK

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:06.307
You're here again, Ms. Wi.

00:54:08.059 --> 00:54:09.018
It's been a long time.

00:54:09.643 --> 00:54:11.187
It's already been seven years.

00:54:11.812 --> 00:54:14.398
You really don't have to come anymore.

00:54:15.524 --> 00:54:16.984
Thank you for everything.

00:54:19.695 --> 00:54:20.780
It's not over yet.

00:54:22.031 --> 00:54:24.658
I'll find out what Mr. Woo wanted to say

00:54:25.326 --> 00:54:27.787
and how his death was staged as a suicide.

00:54:30.414 --> 00:54:32.166
I'll get to the bottom of it.

00:54:32.666 --> 00:54:34.043
EUNSEONGILBO

00:54:42.218 --> 00:54:43.427
My apologies, sir.

00:54:43.511 --> 00:54:45.763
I trust you'll take care of that reporter.

00:54:45.846 --> 00:54:47.473
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:54:49.934 --> 00:54:50.768
A sports tabloid?

00:54:53.354 --> 00:54:55.022
Get back to work, everyone.

00:54:56.148 --> 00:54:58.192
Just work the entertainment desk
for a year, okay?

00:54:58.275 --> 00:54:59.151
The entertainment desk?

00:54:59.985 --> 00:55:02.530
You're bumping me to the sports tabloid,
and not even for a transfer?

00:55:03.072 --> 00:55:05.366
But you saw that video, Chief.
It's a major scoop!

00:55:05.449 --> 00:55:07.201
The video barely shows any faces,

00:55:07.284 --> 00:55:09.745
and there aren't any audible voices,
so how is that a scoop?

00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:12.414
I understand why you want to
sweep this under the rug.

00:55:12.498 --> 00:55:15.584
But let's be honest, Chief.
You recognized who it was.

00:55:16.293 --> 00:55:17.503
Hey.

00:55:17.586 --> 00:55:20.339
One wrong move,
and your petty desire for fame

00:55:21.048 --> 00:55:22.258
will land us in hot water.

00:55:22.883 --> 00:55:24.927
Do you want to see
the entire political desk get wiped out?

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.471
Do you cherry-pick articles
to write for your petty paycheck?

00:55:27.555 --> 00:55:28.848
What the hell did you say?

00:55:28.931 --> 00:55:31.183
You just crossed the line.
How dare you say that?

00:55:33.561 --> 00:55:34.979
I'm a political reporter.

00:55:35.896 --> 00:55:37.398
I refuse to be forced

00:55:38.274 --> 00:55:39.525
to work the entertainment desk.

00:55:43.571 --> 00:55:45.114
That little brat…

00:55:46.115 --> 00:55:47.533
But why is she coming?

00:55:47.616 --> 00:55:50.661
They've been looking for ways
to get rid of her for a while.

00:55:50.744 --> 00:55:52.163
She's addicted to work

00:55:52.246 --> 00:55:54.081
and has absolutely no social skills.

00:55:54.165 --> 00:55:55.583
I hear she's really unlikeable.

00:55:55.666 --> 00:55:57.293
Hey, we're not a damage control team!

00:55:58.419 --> 00:56:01.463
That's enough. Stop making a big deal
out of someone joining us.

00:56:02.047 --> 00:56:04.717
How come none of you seem worried
after writing such a lousy story today?

00:56:06.552 --> 00:56:08.637
The Geumsang Arts Awards is today, right?

00:56:09.221 --> 00:56:12.641
Find out who wore similar dresses
or who was a fashion disaster,

00:56:12.725 --> 00:56:14.351
and write it up before the ceremony.

00:56:14.935 --> 00:56:19.190
The battle of the red carpet dresses.
Who will be the winners and losers?

00:56:19.273 --> 00:56:25.112
First, the organizer of this ceremony
and the one who made today possible.

00:56:25.196 --> 00:56:27.656
Chairman Lee Dae-ho, a young leader

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.742
-guiding the industry forward.
-Chairman!

00:56:29.825 --> 00:56:32.036
-With an aura that could rival an actor,
-Chairman!

00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:33.329
he's stepped onto the red carpet.

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:35.789
Chairman Lee Dae-ho!

00:56:36.373 --> 00:56:37.541
I'm from the political desk!

00:56:38.125 --> 00:56:39.376
Sir! Chairman Lee!

00:56:41.212 --> 00:56:43.297
Excuse me, Chairman Lee!

00:56:44.048 --> 00:56:45.466
I'm from the political desk!

00:56:46.008 --> 00:56:47.885
Sir! Chairman Lee!

00:56:49.178 --> 00:56:53.641
Don't miss out on the man making
an appearance on the red carpet now.

00:56:54.225 --> 00:56:58.187
He's successfully led the drama,
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:00.940
Last year, he won the Best Actor award

00:57:01.023 --> 00:57:04.360
-at the Geumsang Arts Awards…
-Chairman Lee Dae-ho!

00:57:04.443 --> 00:57:05.861
Please comment on
the retaliatory personnel decisions

00:57:05.945 --> 00:57:07.321
taking place at Eunseongilbo!

00:57:08.113 --> 00:57:09.114
Where are you from?

00:57:09.198 --> 00:57:10.324
I'm Wi Jeong-sin from the political desk!

00:57:10.407 --> 00:57:12.785
You've been avoiding my calls
and refusing to meet me,

00:57:12.868 --> 00:57:14.662
so I was forced to come here!

00:57:14.745 --> 00:57:16.080
-Let's talk next time.
-Sir!

00:57:16.163 --> 00:57:18.123
Please cancel my personnel transfer!

00:57:18.207 --> 00:57:19.458
We'll talk next time.

00:57:21.001 --> 00:57:21.961
Excuse me.

00:58:13.887 --> 00:58:15.097
Mr. Lim!

00:59:22.915 --> 00:59:25.209
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:59:28.962 --> 00:59:30.422
Of course, I'm struggling.

00:59:30.506 --> 00:59:32.424
You must have a bad memory.

00:59:32.508 --> 00:59:34.593
We actually met in a very dramatic way.

00:59:34.676 --> 00:59:37.805
There's no way this woman is a reporter.

00:59:38.263 --> 00:59:39.848
You can't embarrass a reporter like that!

00:59:39.932 --> 00:59:41.975
-Do you want to bury Lim Hyeon-jun?
-Yes!

00:59:42.059 --> 00:59:45.187
Everyone has dirt to hide,
and where there's smoke, there's fire.

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:48.774
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin will not be allowed
to take part in this interview.

00:59:48.857 --> 00:59:51.026
Groveling at my feet
wouldn't have been enough!

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:52.778
I'm just returning the favor.

00:59:52.861 --> 00:59:55.489
This reporter is a damn lunatic!

00:59:58.867 --> 01:00:00.869
