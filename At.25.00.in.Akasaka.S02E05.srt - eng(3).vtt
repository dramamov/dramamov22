WEBVTT

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.750
Hayama, I have a favor to ask.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.170
Regarding this audition...

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.960
I want you to drop out.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.460
("Last Note," directed by Imai Gen)

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.540
I'm sure you already know,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.330
Director Imai...
didn't his movie last year do really well?

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.460
This is his next film.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.210
The lead actor had to drop out due to a sudden illness.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.170
Dropped out...

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.710
Originally,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.830
they were supposed to start filming in two months.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.250
So, they're looking for a new leading man.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.330
The director mentioned one actor in particular.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.540
He said, "If he's the one playing the part, I have no objections."

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.630
He wants you for the lead role.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.380
However...

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.380
If filming starts in two months, your schedule...

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.710
Exactly.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.920
If you're chosen in the final audition
for "Rain and Confession"...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.040
the film's shooting schedule

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630
will completely overlap with the play.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630
I...

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.710
I want to see the audition through to the end.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.000
It's a project I've always wanted to do.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.130
Akeno-san.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.960
Hayama, I think...

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.000
for your acting career...

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.250
this will be a major turning point.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.170
If you star in this film,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.500
your recognition and reputation as an actor

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.750
will rise to a whole new level.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.000
I know.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.290
I know you want to do "Rain and Confession".

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.170
And you've already made it to the final audition.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.170
It's cruel of me to bring this up now,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.710
but...

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.170
you absolutely cannot pass up this opportunity.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.080
Hayama.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.710
I believe what you should do right now

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.920
is take this movie role.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.380
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 5)

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.580
(New message from Sakuma)

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.540
How's it going?

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.670
I just got off work. I'm in Akasaka now.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.250
Hayama, are you free?

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.210
So, how have you been?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.460
- How have I been about what?
- Oh, nothing.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.960
Hayama, you made it to the final round too, right?

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.420
Yeah.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.710
I made it to the end too.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.290
We might get to be in the play together.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.380
- Sakuma.
- Hm?

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.500
If the job you want to do

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.460
conflicts with the job you should do,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.420
what would you choose?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.750
You've been in this business a long time.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.710
I'm sure you've faced that kind of situation before.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.710
Huh?

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.500
What are you smiling about?

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.380
Oh, nothing. It's just... this is a rare sight.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.080
What do you mean?

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.420
Hayama, you're actually coming to me for advice.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.750
- Is that so strange?
- Yeah.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.210
I know it's not right for me to say this
when you're so troubled,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.290
but I'm honestly happy.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.250
Just forget I asked.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.080
I'm sorry.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.580
Well...

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
About your question,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.880
I've been there.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.420
What did you do then?

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.960
Well... after talking it over with my agent,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.210
I ended up choosing the job I was supposed to do.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.250
- I see.
- Yeah.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.880
After all, when it comes to your so-called "status"...

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.460
to some extent, until you're on solid ground,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.000
it's best to take whatever work
comes your way, isn't it?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.170
Besides, my agent was just trying to make me a star,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.710
so they were looking out for my best interests.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.210
Right.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.210
That makes sense.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.000
But you're different, Hayama.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.920
Huh?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.540
I mean, you're not like I was back then.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.960
Where you are now,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.880
I think you have the right to choose.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.330
Because you, Hayama,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.920
have already established yourself, haven't you?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.920
That being the case,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.130
the "selfishness" of sticking to the work you want to do...

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.920
Well... maybe "selfishness" isn't the right word.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.670
How should I put it?

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.000
It's your will.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.630
- My will?
- Yes, your will.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.130
The will to follow through on what you want to do.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.920
I think you're in a position to make that choice.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.540
Choose the job you truly want.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.790
(Expressing the novel's beauty through physical performance)

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.420
Are you going to get in my way too?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.790
Asami-san.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.710
I'm home.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.130
Welcome home.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.540
Shirasaki.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.670
If you're going to sleep, go to bed.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.290
I'm sleeping with Asami-san.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.130
That's great.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.210
Looks like our "in-house separation" is over.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.750
Oh, right.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.750
That's right.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.380
We're still separated.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.670
That thing...

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.710
it's not over yet?

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.750
Nope. Still on.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.750
I see.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.920
Sorry.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.960
I was half-asleep and forgot.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.000
It's fine.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.920
I was kind of hoping you'd stay half-asleep.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.580
No need.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.290
It's fine, I'm wide awake now.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.170
I see.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.330
Hmm?

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.670
Huh?

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.960
I heard that for this brand's
new spokesperson,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.960
Shirasaki's name is on the list of candidates.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.710
Oh, this?

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.670
It's a lipstick I got from a commercial shoot.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.500
Do you want it?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.380
No, thanks.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.380
Huh?

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.210
I'll get it on my own.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.130
I see.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.380
Yes.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.330
Besides, the colors that suit you and me are different, right?

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.130
That's not what I meant...

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.330
It's fine.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.670
Good night, Asami-san.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.080
("Last Note")
This has also been a long-term project for Director Imai.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.170
And there's not much time before filming begins.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.460
We know this is a difficult thing to ask.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.580
However...

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.540
if we could have you in the leading role, Hayama-san,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.210
I believe this will undoubtedly be a wonderful film.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.250
Hayama-san.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.710
Hayama-san, I have seen many of your works.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.670
You have a glamorous aura,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.790
but deep down,

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:57.000
there seems to be this undercurrent
of lingering sadness and loneliness.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.170
If you were to portray
this protagonist, Hayama-san,

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.580
I know we can create a fantastic film.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:17.380
We've revised the script
with you in mind, Hayama-san.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.380
Hayama-san.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.460
This film will absolutely be brilliant.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.040
To make that happen,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.790
we sincerely ask you to lend us your strength.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.170
Excuse me.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.130
Please give me some time to think.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.630
Shirasaki.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.380
I'm sorry.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.920
Why are you apologizing?

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.210
About that commercial.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.920
The cosmetics brand
that Hayama-san also endorses.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.250
They've decided to go with another actor.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.420
I'm sorry, Shirasaki.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.210
Why are you apologizing to me, Shinoda-san?

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.710
Because I'm not capable enough as your manager.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.750
No, that's not it.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.880
It was my fault.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.880
I wasn't chosen.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.130
I just wasn't good enough.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.920
("Rain and Confession," "Last Note")

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.790
I really love a novel
called "Rain and Confession".

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.210
It makes me wonder...

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.580
how I would interpret that character.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.710
I guess that makes us
true rivals now, doesn't it?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.250
(Play: "Rain and Confession"
Final Audition)

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.960
Alright, if there is anything you feel you must say,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.460
or any questions, please ask.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.170
Um...

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.290
Well...

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.000
It's all right.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.330
Go ahead.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.670
This is the final audition.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.830
Feel free to say whatever is on your mind.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.040
I think...

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.670
I think I understand now.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.920
Muroga's feelings.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.130
Like... why he had to kill.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:59.290
Why did he keep committing murder?

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.880
Even though he was tormented by guilt,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.460
why couldn't he give up on connecting with people?

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.710
He longed to be chosen.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.330
Muroga...

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.580
all this time,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.290
has he just been hoping for someone to need him?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.420
He just...

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.540
wanted to be chosen.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.250
But that wish was never granted.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.670
Muroga's heart...

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.080
must have slowly become twisted.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.580
That's what I believe.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.750
So that's how you see Muroga?

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.710
Yes.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.750
I see. Thank you.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.670
Thank you.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.210
Excuse me.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.250
I'm home.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.960
Asami-san, welcome home.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.000
Thanks.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.130
Shirasaki, welcome home to you too.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.170
I gave it my all.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.920
I don't know if it was good enough,

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.170
but I did everything I possibly could.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.380
What about you, Asami-san?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.250
Asami-san?

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.880
I'm sorry, Shirasaki.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.880
I...

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.380
didn't go to the final audition today.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.130
What?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.250
I dropped out.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.080
What do you mean, you dropped out?

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.500
Why?

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.540
I got a movie offer.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.580
And the shooting schedule for that film...

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.040
was a direct conflict with the audition.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.040
So you chose the movie?

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.130
Yeah.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.750
Akeno-san.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.540
I'll...

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.210
take the offer.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.380
Are you sure?

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.460
Yes.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.420
Understood.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.830
Hayama...

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.710
Thank you.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.380
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.290
But...

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.000
I didn't want to say anything
to distract you before your audition.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.000
Asami-san...

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.710
Are you really okay with this?

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.750
The director... out of all the actors,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.790
chose me.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.630
If he wants me that badly,

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.580
and has such high hopes for me,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.420
I want to live up to those expectations.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.290
I completely understand
why people have such high hopes for you, Asami-san.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.710
But are you sure you're not ignoring
what you truly want?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.580
Thank you.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.790
Shirasaki.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.790
But it's alright.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.210
Living up to others' expectations...

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.960
is my job.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.170
Asami-san.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.670
Can I sleep with you tonight?

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.670
What about our "in-house separation"?

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.000
Is that over now?

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.580
Yeah.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.290
It's over.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.330
I see.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.920
Shirasaki.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.210
The audition results are in.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.920
Yeah.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.170
Hello?

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.960
Asami-san?

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.250
I... I got the part.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.210
Congratulations.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.710
Shirasaki.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.710
I still can't believe it.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.920
This calls for a celebration.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040
Huh?

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.750
Wait...

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.040
Oh, you don't have to.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.000
I want to celebrate you.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.670
Okay?

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:58.960
Okay.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.710
Shirasaki.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.670
I need to discuss the rehearsal space...

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.790
I'll head over now.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.290
Okay.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.130
Good luck.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.130
Right.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.580
(Rain and Confession)

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.290
(This is a work of fiction.)

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.750
(Next Episode)
I told you, I did nothing!

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.330
A standard performance won't cut it.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.580
Hayama-san, what I need from you on set
is your raw, honest emotion.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.670
What's wrong?

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.630
Did something happen?

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.630
Am I really there for Asami-san?

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.500
I can't believe someone attacked me in my sleep.
