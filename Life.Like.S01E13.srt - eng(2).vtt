Yao?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.790
You're here this early morning.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.360
Is it something urgent?

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.520
Morning?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.800
Look at the time now.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.680
Are you without a watch?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.560
Someone threw wine bottles
into my place last night.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.240
Darn it, I didn't sleep a wink!

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.400
You were lucky enough

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.600
to wake up late.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.360
Captain Luo.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.280
Good morning.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.320
Morning...

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.920
Good morning, Ms. Rose.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.760
Who would wake up sleeping next to her?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.280
Well,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.920
Yao,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.640
have a seat here.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.920
Go back inside and put on some clothes.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.160
Yao.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.480
Why are you here this early morning?

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.680
Yamamoto will be holding a banquet.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.960
Boss wants you to join it.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.480
(Yamamoto...)

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.040
(That's a Japanese.)

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.640
Today?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.800
Now.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.600
Oh?

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.760
If so, I'll go get ready now.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.640
Go ahead.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.400
Get yourself ready.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.880
I'll wait for you here.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.560
You should wait outside.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.660
Wait for me out there.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.200
I was standing there for so long.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.200
Wait...

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.620
It's all right to wait for you in there.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:00.720
Wait...

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.480
Hey.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.200
Hurry up.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.840
What's the matter?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.000
You seem distracted.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.640
Yamamoto

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.600
is a Japanese?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.520
Zhou Musheng.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.640
Quick.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.480
Coming.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.040
I'm off.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.040
Mm.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.080
Xu.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.840
Head to the tailor's.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840
Your outfits are ready.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.440
That was fast.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.600
Didn't you say it'd take several days?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.200
Those outfits are for you.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.240
Of course I had to make it quick.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.600
Wait for my return.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.840
Zhou Musheng.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.920
Well,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.120
come home soon.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.360
Sure.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.160
Let's go, Yao.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.560
Let's go.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.520

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.480

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.400
Sure thing!

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.640
This has been an extraordinary day.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.200
(What is she)

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.920
(up to again?)

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.320
I'm telling you, Yamamoto.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.320
Du Hongyue has never trusted me.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.000
When it comes to you, he...

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.880
Do you get it?

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.400
Are you telling the truth?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.680
Playing dumb, huh?

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.920
You know it all too well.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.240
Someday,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.640
if I

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.560
become the chairman
of North City Chamber of Commerce,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.080
I will take our chamber of commerce

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.240
to new heights.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.360
It belongs to me

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.640
and you.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.720
As soon as

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.040
I get rid of him.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.400
Here.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.000
