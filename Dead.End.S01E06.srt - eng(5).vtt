[Episode 6]

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.180
Why won't you let us go?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.350
How many times do we have to say it?

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.200
We need to go home.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.070
You can go home

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.040
as soon as we finish the paperwork.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.400
Okay?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.440
Let me ask you,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.210
who was in charge of

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.610
his ward last night?

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.039
I really don't know.

[Medical Excellence, Compassionate Care]

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:29.940
What happened?

[Advanced Skill, Meticulous Treatment]

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.079
He was already like this

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.190
when I arrived from home.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.320
I don't know either.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.590
Did you give him his medication

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.680
before bed last night?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.480
Did he take it?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.470
Yes.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.560
He took it.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.430
I watched him take it.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.829
If he took his medication,
how could he have jumped on his own?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.310
The hospital windows

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.840
are supposed to have safety locks.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.560
They do,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560
but what unluchy is

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.120
that the safety lock
on that window was faulty.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.650
Captain,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.530
I just went to the restroom.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.910
He was still here right before I left.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.310
I saw him with my own eyes.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.430
Then she came up,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.700
and then there were just pillows.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.560
He must have slipped out

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560
during that time.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.000
What time did you go to the restroom?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.840
Around 10:30.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.970
How long were you gone?

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.329
Less than half an hour.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.430
You were in the restroom for half an hour?

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.430
Wait, Captain...

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.150
Do you realize this could

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.150
cost you your badge?

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.680
Captain,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.520
I'll accept any disciplinary action.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.579
This is beyond disciplinary action.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.990
Disciplinary action...

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.630
Is everyone out?

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.690

Let me check...

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.870
It seems like Zhao from our station

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.000

-Gu Feng. Hurry up.

The cola bottle.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.390
It's the cola bottle.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.270
Are you moving stuff?

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.750
Yes.

What's going on? Is everyone leaving?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.920
There's an incident in the north side.

They've been called for backup.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.780
Is there a case?

A big one.

It's about time. We should go.

At least finish your meal before leaving.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.270
Let me tell you,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.950
the bigger the case,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.000
the more you can't afford to rush.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
We have no choice.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.830
Hey, you guys,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.800

it's a small token,
just a gesture of respect.

Don't worry,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.270
it's already been reported
and credited to you.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.930
But the case isn't solved yet.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.480
Right.

This case remains unsolved,

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.680
but the main suspect is dead.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.870
Let's shelve it for now.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.120
Also, the murder weapon hasn't been found,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.390
so we'll need to trouble the colleagues

What if Crazy Wu isn't the killer?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.930
His nurse said it couldn't be him.

He also mentioned before

that he felt nauseated

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.750
It's very possible

he witnessed it from nearby.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.310
Crazy Wu might not be the killer

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.120
but a witness.

A nurse from the mental hospital

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.870

[A Dedicated Detective,
A Passionate Public Servant]

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.920
Buddy, you've been spending too much time

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.650
at the mental hospital lately.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.270
You'd better stop going there.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.190
So you've decided

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.800
it's a suicide out of guilt, right?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.680
Just pin it all on him

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.190
and you can
wash your hands of this, right?

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.390
What do you want then?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.000
What do you expect us to do?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.510
Gan'e,

solving cases

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.820
requires physical evidence.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.870
You can't just go

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.680
by what a psychiatric patient says,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.270
understand?

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.120
Yes, but now...

What do you mean, "what happened"?

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.400
He got slapped

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.110
across the face in front of everyone.

Didn't you see that?

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.830
Your mentor's never been humiliated

You're his apprentice;

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.460
you should show some concern for him.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.680

So quit overthinking everything.

Wait a bit longer.

Your mentor is Mr. Tian, right?

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960
Back in the day
he was a big-name detective

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.560
in the Criminal Police Team.

that I nearly got my mentor killed.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.480

that bastard every single day,

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.270
trying to catch him—
figured that bringing him in

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.670
would be some kind of
justice for my mentor.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.640
Did you catch him?

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.360
I was fixated on getting him

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.130
that I couldn't do anything else.

I ran into Zhou Weiping yesterday.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.530
What did he tell you?

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.080
Let's go.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.719
I didn't call a taxi.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.290
Let's go.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.670
Your friend already called one

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.760
to take you to the second venue.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.020
It's already paid for.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.670
How considerate.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.670
Go!

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.280
Get down here!

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.800
What are you doing?

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.460
Where is it?

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:42.880
What's going on?

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.510
Look at me.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.500
Do you know who I am?

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.710
Weren't you locked up

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.480
for running someone over?

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.540
How did you get out?

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.510
The most important thing

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.840
in this world to me

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.000
is family.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.920
That old lady I hit

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.840
has no family.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.000
I wanted to compensate her,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.530
but I didn't even know
who to give the money to.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.000
So you saved yourself
some money, didn't you?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.600
That worked out well for you.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.360
But I have family.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.760
She was my only family left.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.030
You know that.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.010
Bro, I'm sorry.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.010

I...

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.760
I heard that on the night

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.400
my daughter had her accident,

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.360
that bitch was the one

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.620
who stopped you from answering the door.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.280
No.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.400
I don't know.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.280
Bro.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.670
Bro.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.150
Bro.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.880
Take a guess

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.550
when I was driving,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.230
do you think I knew

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.920
there was someone under my wheels?

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.070
Bro, please! I... I was wrong!

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:48.760
Bro!

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.320
I told him

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.710
I'd already cut it off with Huang Hui,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.190
that we weren't in contact anymore!

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.990
You think he did it for Huang Hui?

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.420
He did it for his daughter.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.840
Ran,

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.210
there's something

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.000
I need to report to you

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.070
about his daughter.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.150
But you have to promise me

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.880
that Zhou Weiping won't

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.880
come after me again.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.680
Tell me first;

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.680
let's hear it.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.230
A while ago,

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.030
business was slow at my barbershop,

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.670
so I stood by the door for a bit.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.360
I noticed

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.760
a girl getting into a black,

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.920
stretched limo.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:30.040
She looked a lot like Liu Ke.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:32.360
There was a man sitting inside.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.150
Judging by his clothes,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.610
he wasn't a decent person.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.880
When I asked you before,

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.920
why didn't you tell me?

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.400
I wasn't sure what I saw.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.590
Besides, the poor girl's already gone.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.250
Saying this now would
just ruin her reputation.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:47.190

00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:00.110
The one who can't let go of you is me.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.320
Please come with me.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.360
The one who can't live without you is me.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840
Before Liu Ke died,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.480
there was a cassette in her Walkman.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.680
I heard it that night.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.640
It was this song.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.630
But this isn't the original singer;

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.030
it's a cover by someone.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:17.630
And this entire tape

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.160
only has this one song on it,

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.880
recorded five times on each side.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.210
I had the Criminal Police Team
make a copy.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.840
So the person singing this

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.770
must have been very close to Liu Ke.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.840
That makes this person highly suspicious.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.280
He has a black limousine

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.220
and is fond of singing.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.760
Then we need to go find out

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.590
who cared about her the most.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.630
- Get off!
- Get off!

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.110
Get off.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.000
Mr. Hei,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.080
we can't unload the truck today.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.440
Mr. Hei,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.840
the club just called.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.840
The cops are there causing trouble.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.000
Bro,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.410
what's the situation here?

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.950
Put the word out to the brothers:

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.000
I, Little Erhei,

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.550
am done playing nice
with Crazy Monk today.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.440
Everyone, move in!
