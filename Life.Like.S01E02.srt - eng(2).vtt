Boss, you wanted to see me?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.920
Did you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.240
send Zhou Musheng back last night?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.120
Yeah, we did.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.920
He even took Rose home.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.920
As the saying goes,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.280
even heroes stumble
when faced with a beauty.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.640
(Who knew
Zhou Musheng was such a gentleman?)

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.800
(This is a pleasant surprise.)

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.240
You didn't see

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.400
how many positions they…

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.320
Musheng.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.200
You're here.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.920
Sir.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.240
Sir.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.520
I hope I didn't disturb you.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.680
Not at all.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.160
Musheng.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.840
You must be tired after last night.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.200
It's a good thing you're young.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.920
You don't look run down.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.400
You tease.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.640
Sir.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.320
I heard

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.000
you like this kind of thing.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.120
This is from my hometown.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.560
They say

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.360
it came from the palace.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.440
Your family owns

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.200
these sorts of rare items?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.670
It was passed down through generations.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.560
It's not worth much.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.980
It's just a little something from me.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.440
Please accept it.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.600
There's an operation tonight.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.320
Wait in the office.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.800
When the time's set,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.480
I'll have Liu notify you.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.160
What operation?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.360
A while back,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.040
we intercepted a weapons shipment.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.320
We found a buyer, so I figured
we should deal with it.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.200
We should move it off our hands quickly.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.000
What happened?

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.520
There's a traitor among us…

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.280
Understood.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.680
Who are you looking for?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.680
Oh,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.600
isn't this Ms. Rose?

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.440
What brings you here?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.920
I'm looking for Zhou Musheng.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.400
Please.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.600
(This is a test.)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.920
(Zhou Musheng knows
that this batch of weapons)

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.200
(was the one the North City
Chamber of Commerce intercepted,)

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.320
(the shipment meant for the front.)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.120
(However, he can't leave now.)

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.560
(How can he get the word out?)

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.080
He's inside.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.240
Go on in.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
What are you doing here?

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.800
You just took up your new post.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.200
I came

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.640
to congratulate you.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.240
I'm just a singer at Night Shanghai.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.000
I don't understand any of this stuff.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.160
You only came

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.240
to congratulate me?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.480
You told me

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.600
to put on a good show last night.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.320
I'm here to perform for you.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.040
Oh!

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.280
Sorry!

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.000
My goodness!

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
In the office?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.120
Well, I'll be going then…

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.080
What's wrong?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.480
Liu, did you need something?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.880
Sorry

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.160
to interrupt.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.760
Not at all.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.480
We were just…

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.120
Hey.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.160
You don't have to explain.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.040
I get it.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.160
There's business.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.080
7 PM tonight,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.440
Riverside Pier.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.720
I'll head off now.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.520
Goodbye, Liu.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.360
Carry on.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.060
Since I'm not needed here,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.000
I'll take my leave too.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.400
Wait.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
You're leaving so soon?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.400
I don't want to keep you from work.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.800
I was supposed

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.790
to pick up clothes from the tailor
this afternoon.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.780
Something came up.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.760
I can't make it.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.000
Could you

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.720
do me a favor

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.880
and pick them up?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.480
Musheng,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.560
am I supposed to start

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.880
getting used to this new role?

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.160
We'll both

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.920
have to adjust.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.840
7 PM tonight,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.200
Riverside Pier.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.480
(7 PM tonight,)

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.600
(Riverside Pier.)

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.680
(It might be that shipment of weapons.)

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.680
I need to check it out.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.040
Hello.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.780
Zhou Musheng sent me
to pick up his clothes.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.100
(Pickup name: Zhou Musheng)

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.320
All right.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.260
Please give me a moment.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.600
What's your relation to him?

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.520
My relation?

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.440
You'll have to ask him.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.460
(7 PM tonight, Riverside Pier.)

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.960
The shipment
the Chamber of Commerce seized

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.960
will be sold to the Japanese tonight
through Scarface.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.280
Those traitors…

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.720
Who's there?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.480
Yue.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.340
It's been a long time since we last met.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.920
I hope you've been well.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.120
Liu, get the car!

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.480
Act

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.760
when necessary.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.360
Let's go.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.640
(Oh, no!)

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.360
