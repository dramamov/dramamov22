[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Episode 29]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.770
Where did you guys hit it off at first sight?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.900
At the Pleasure House, of course.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.690
The place was full of drunks.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.540
Only Mr. Su and I kept our cool.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.210
I'll take my leave.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.570
Let's go.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.100
Take care, Mr. Su.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.770
Prince of Langya...

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.220
After dark,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.660
Tianqi City is easier on the eyes than by day.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.730
You don't like Tianqi City?

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.450
I don't.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.780
It's too big here.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.240
The houses are big.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.060
The streets are wide.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.940
Even the food is big.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.980
An osmanthus cake

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.450
is the size of a brick!

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.200
Does a bigger cake

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.660
mean better taste?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.450
Nan'an...

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.100
Nan'an...

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380
I want to go back to Nan'an...

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.100
We shouldn't stay long.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.940
Oh, Su Muyu,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.180
now that we're in Tianqi City,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.500
shouldn't we keep a low profile?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.850
Opening a clinic here

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.290
pretty much tells everyone

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.380
we're right here.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.430
Why can't Blood River

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.890
enter Tianqi City?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.820
It's just a sect in the imperial city.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.940
We'll tell everyone

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.410
we're here.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.410
Every move we make

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.540
can stand in the open.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.260
What's there to fear?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.980
Exactly!

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.980
What is it?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.410
Is it that snake from the Medicine King?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.980
Yes.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.610
Baicao gave me this one.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.690
It's paired with the one Night Crow keeps,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.940
life-and-death linked.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.260
When they get close,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.450
they react.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.450
So, Night Crow is nearby.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.100
You should head back to the inn.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.130
I'll go take a look.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.220
My martial niece is vicious,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.690
and good at every dirty trick!

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.060
I'll go with you.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.280
No need to worry.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.570
I'll go with Muyu.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.730
All right.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.540
Then be extra careful.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.660
Don't worry.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.100
Yumo,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.930
weren't you staying at the inn

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.050
with Changhe?

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.490
Why are you here?

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.730
Among those people,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.540
one was Tang Lianyue.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.170
So,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.810
you were tailing Tang Lianyue first?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.220
Quit asking.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.980
Let's move.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.860
Remove the puppet poison

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.900
from my senior,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.370
or you won't leave alive!

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.140
Oh, really?

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.170
Master Su.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.370
Seems someone can't see me.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.700
Miss Mu.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.660
Xuanwu Guardian,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.810
you're in trouble now.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.730
Master Su,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.700
I expect you to lend me a hand.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.850
Looks like tonight,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.140
I've got two fine whetstones.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.410
Ghost Physician Night Crow,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.540
I don't like

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.170
this Tang clan prodigy next to you,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.900
but I like you even less,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.930
someone who toys

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.900
with people's lives.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.220
The miracle physician said,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.050
if we ever meet you,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.810
I should kill you, traitor,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.170
for the Medicine King Valley.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.290
Seems you do heed

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.660
my senior.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.780
But taking my life

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.250
won't be that easy.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.170
Go!

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.700
Who is he?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.370
He's the Tang clan's deputy master,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.370
Tang Linghuang.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.780
Master Su,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.370
if you help me save my senior,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.220
I will remember

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.580
this favor for life.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.980
Favor?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.460
To repay it,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.980
you'd do anything?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.290
So long as it doesn't cross the line.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.660
Save it.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.580
Die!

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.370
That was "Tide Rising"

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.340
from the Springwater Sword.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.220
Muyu,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.610
why not use the Eighteen-Sword Array?

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.410
Tang Lianyue wants him saved,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.730
not dead.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.660
The Eighteen-Sword Array kills.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.490
It can't save.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.050
Yumo,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.250
trap Night Crow first.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.460
Thousand-Spider Array,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:45.410
activate!

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.340
Darn it!

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.540
My senior never learned Poison-Sand Palm.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.290
It's poison drawn off Xuewei.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.490
Fine.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.140
It was just a test

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.700
of this Gold-Body Puppet's power.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.140
That's enough fun

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.900
for tonight.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.810
Let's go!

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.930
Don't run!

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.730
Senior!

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.660
Thanks to Miss Bai's snake.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.730
Darn it.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.100
You learned it just now.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.370
Even if you find Night Crow,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.380
you still can't

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.660
save your senior from her.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.540
What did they do to my senior?

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.540
One thing you can trust.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.900
As a Gold-Body Puppet,

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.420
he's still alive,

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.130
just unconscious.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.580
His martial skill

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.340
will even improve.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.810
If I'm right,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.060
though he's your senior,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.850
and much older,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.330
the two of you

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.770
are roughly equals.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.770
But just now,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.370
he took on two of us

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.940
and had the upper hand.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.250
So how do we break the puppet poison?

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:57.770
I don't know.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.850
You don't?

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.220
I only know

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.850
there's just one way to kill a drugged puppet:

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.340
pierce the heart

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.180
and grind it to pulp.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.790
I know you're anxious,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.970
but your senior's life

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.460
is in others' hands.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.940
We can only wait.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.650
We'll meet again soon.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.650
Yumo,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.850
let's go.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.580
Master,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.370
why don't you go in and sleep?

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.010
Changhe and I will wait here.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.060
I'm uneasy.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.010
I can't sleep.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.490
Miracle physician...

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.180
Bored of waiting?

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.580
I'll do a trick for you.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.490
What trick?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.130
Hand it here.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.940
Wow, that's an eye-opener!

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.010
Just a parlor trick.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.460
You're back.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.730
Yeah.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.610
You look a bit worse for wear.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.220
What master did you run into?

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.060
Tang Linghuang

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.370
of the Tang clan.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.010
Oh, the future grand master of the Tang clan.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.010
He finally showed himself.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.770
He's a tough one.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.490
Still,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.130
why would he attack you?

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:13.850
He was turned into a drugged puppet.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.700
What?

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.530
Tang Linghuang was made a drugged puppet?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.930
A Heaven-level master

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.100
was made into a puppet...

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.490
She really created

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.300
the perfect Gold-Body Puppet

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.980
of legend!

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.340
Li Xinyue has agreed

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.420
to reach Prince of Langya for us.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.460
Do you think

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.700
he'll work with us?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.610
He should hate us after all.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.610
He founded the Inner Security Division

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.820
because he thinks the Shadow Sect should not exist.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.580
He likes things out in the open.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.850
But we...

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.610
don't really fit that.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.220
We're not the old Blood River anymore.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.220
He will come meet us.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.530
People's bias is hard to uproot.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.460
You're that sure?

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.490
He's Prince of Langya.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.490
If he sees like the crowd,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.470
that means

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.220
we chose the wrong partner.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.700
Then let Blood River's tide

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.580
truly surge into Tianqi.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.890
Why are you two here so early today?

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.250
We've got urgent business to report!

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.010
You look even more pressed.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.980
You go first.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.100
I found my senior's trail last night.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.180
He's under the ghost physician Night Crow,

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.730
already forged into a puppet,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.220
hiding in Tianqi City.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.180
Yesterday,

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.220
Master Su and I

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.700
tried together to save him.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.890
But as a puppet now,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.130
his strength was too great.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.530
He got away in the end.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.490
Wait.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.220
Master Su?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.650
The Umbrella Ghost?

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.820
That's why I'm here.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.540
[Loyal and Dutiful]
Blood River Patriarch

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.730
and the three current family heads

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.530
brought a squad of Blood River elites

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.010
into Tianqi City together.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.340
But,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.580
they haven't tried to hide it.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:34.730
Yesterday,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.850
I found them.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.460
They said

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.940
they want to meet you.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.940
Blood River

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.890
has been tangled with me

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.980
since the late emperor's time.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.340
What do they want with me?

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.770
They say they want to work with you.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.060
Last time they came to Tianqi,

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.700
one of them told me

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.130
they'd build

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.220
a new Blood River.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.850
What do you think?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.010
Best not to meet them.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.890
Rumors are flying in Tianqi City.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.460
If it gets out

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.980
Prince of Langya met Blood River in secret,

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.220
it will be a headache.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.490
Lianyue,

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.420
what do you think?

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.220
I think

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.940
they mean no harm.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.220
Let's meet them, then.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.900
[Three days later, meet at Fengxue Tower]

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720
Three days from now,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.180
he'll meet us at Fengxue Tower.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.620
That's the big restaurant in the south of Tianqi!

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.800
I hear their steamed fish is great.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.850
Naturally, you're coming too.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.300
I'm not with Blood River.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.770
You're there to talk business.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.730
What's the point of me going?

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.770
Eating fish, of course.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.580
Oh, right.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.730
I'm in then.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.420
But this should be a secret meeting.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.420
Why did he pick

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.460
a restaurant?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.340
Maybe because he's Prince of Langya,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.490
the most powerful man in Tianqi City.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.850
That's his leverage.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.940
Looks like

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.700
we'll be staying

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.820
in Tianqi City.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.850
We're invited to the feast

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.610
three days from now.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.700
But our clinic opens

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.250
the day after tomorrow.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.730
Then we'll open it first.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.180
That way we have a public face

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.940
here in Tianqi City.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.850
He-Yu Clinic, Tianqi Branch,

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.340
opens the day after tomorrow.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.010
Do you need me?

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.980
No!

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.130
It's been a while.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.060
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.460
I'd like to see

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.220
the one you spoke of,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.250
the near-perfect

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.340
Gold-Body Puppet.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.420
As you wish.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.610
Halt!

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.530
How dare you!

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.340
Good!

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.010
Night Crow, you've got nerve.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:13.940
It's fine.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.340
What do you think, Your Highness?

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.610
Not like the old drugged puppets,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:19.820
dull and wooden.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.370
This Gold-Body Puppet is agile,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.940
and...

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.460
that punch just now

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.650
had the force of a Heaven-level master,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.940
Not a common Heaven-level one.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.820
Your Highness,

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.940
who is your strongest guard?

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.730
Why ask that out of the blue?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.650
I assume

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.650
it's a formidable Heaven-level master.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.940
If you dare,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.610
let him test

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.700
my Gold-Body Puppet.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.010
I'm confident

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.610
the one who wins

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.060
will be this puppet.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.180
May this puppet's power

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.180
reach the Spirit-Roam level?

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.530
Your Highness's standards

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.490
are quite high.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.140
Our target

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.620
is Prince of Langya.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.220
He has four guardians,

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.010
each one

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.860
a Free-Heaven level master.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.290
So, Night Crow,

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.250
I expect

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.010
an even finer Gold-Body Puppet.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.980
I will not fail.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.620
Master,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.900
did you see

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:41.810
that punch just now?

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.170
Do you think

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.630
Night Crow's bluffing?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.700
That puppet's body

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.830
is Tang Linghuang,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.980
the next grand master of Tang clan.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.730
Its strength

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.370
should have touched

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.460
the Grand-Free threshold.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.190
Compared to me now,

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.420
it's still a step short.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.140
I see.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.730
Master,

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.290
if you two join forces,

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.140
can you kill Prince of Langya?

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.220
Yong,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.860
Is your aim

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.180
just to kill Prince of Langya?

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.050
He's the biggest obstacle

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.250
in our path.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.220
Even if Prince of Langya dies,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.940
His Majesty's favorite

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.820
is still the Sixth Prince Xiao Chuhe.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.610
That won't change a bit.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.980
What we must do

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.260
is make His Majesty stop trusting Prince of Langya.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:56.910
And make him

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.290
distrust Xiao Chuhe,

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.980
Prince of Langya's closest ally.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.090
Only then,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.660
the Dragonseal Scroll

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.380
will bear

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.620
your name.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.220
I was too hasty, Master.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.010
Return to the palace later tonight.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.250
At Qiushui Cottage,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.140
I've arranged a distinguished guest.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.420
Have a drink with him

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.700
before heading back.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:33.980
A guest?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.860
What kind of guest

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.660
worth the word "distinguished"?

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.090
Blood River's current leader,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.940
the Patriarch,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.860
Su Changhe.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.860
Well now,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.810
this just got interesting.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.660
What are you looking at?

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:29.810
The mortal world.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.730
I, Blood River's "devil",

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:38.730
am looking at the mortal world.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.490
Changhe,

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.530
you seem to have more of that everyday warmth now.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.010
Everyday warmth?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.420
Not really.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.380
If I caught any,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.770
it's from time with you and the miracle physician.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.330
I was just watching

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.940
this bustling market

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.330
and wondering...

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:11.900
is an ordinary life

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.180
meaningful?

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.040
No feuds of the jianghu,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.460
no courtly plots,

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.280
just ordinary days,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.420
haggling over rice and oil,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.290
living on and on...

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.460
It is meaningful.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.090
Everyone lives differently.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.060
A steady life like that

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.200
is already a luxury

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.810
for many people.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.540
Aren't we fighting

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.220
to bring Blood River

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.010
back into the light?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.490
So Blood River's all folks,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.010
not just you and me,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.940
can choose other paths.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.090
So they won't be other's blades

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.530
or shadows in the dark.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.620
How they live from now on,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.290
how they go on,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.860
is their choice.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.480
If you had a choice,

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:57.700
Changhe,

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.090
what would you do?

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.050
No "if".

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.940
Even without choice,

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.530
I'd cut a new path.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.730
Speaking of choices,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.140
do you truly trust Prince of Langya?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.460
Why ask?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.140
If he were so sound,

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.700
why end up

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.050
in such a bind?

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.010
The emperor wary of him.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.380
The princes fearing him.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.290
And he himself walking on eggshells.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.940
If you ask me...

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.810
forget it.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.530
You won't like it.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.660
Weren't you buying herbs with the miracle physician?

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:42.900
Go on then.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.490
I'll sit this one out.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.700
I'm done

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.810
just watching this world.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.380
I'm going downstairs

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.320
to experience it for myself.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.460
Everyone knows

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.220
Tianqi's best wine

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.090
is at Diaolou Cottage,

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.770
their famed Autumn Dew.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.700
This is my first time tasting Autumn Waters

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.250
from Qiushui Cottage.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.180
Autumn Dew

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.290
is brewed once a month,

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.380
and served for only four hours.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.460
But Autumn Waters here

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.660
appears only once a year,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.380
for just three days each autumn.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.620
Sir, your timing

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.900
is just perfect.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.330
How is it?

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.010
I don't drink.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.900
Why not?

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.530
Sometimes I can drink all night,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.730
sometimes one sip floors me.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.140
As for wine,

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.420
it means nothing special to me.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.140
I'm not like Sikong Changfeng

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.660
or Baili Dongjun.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.900
I'm no hard-drinking wanderer.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.570
I'm...

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.380
What?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.770
The ferryman to the Other Shore.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.330
What is the Other Shore?

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.900
Yong,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.530
don't be so tense.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.660
Sorry.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.050
Master.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.490
Go on, Sir.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.420
His Highness just called you "Master".

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.250
I didn't expect that.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.290
I thought your disciples

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.380
were only the Five Great Eunuchs.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.420
I entered the palace as a child.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.980
I was frail by birth,

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.180
and bullied for years.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.310
Until I was sent to Yongle Palace,

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.770
where I met Consort Shu.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.900
At last, someone cared for me.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.090
Consort Shu

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.090
was gentle and kind, generous to all.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.380
Seeing my frailty, she urged me to train.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.220
She even brought out

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.220
clan manuals for me to study.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.660
Among them was a partial manual

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.010
titled "The Humble Heart".

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.700
I studied it for years

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.770
before grasping this unique art.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.090
Consort Shu...

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.010
Is she your mother?

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.420
She was consort

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.980
to the late Emperor Tai'an,

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.420
and my mother's aunt.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.460
Consort Shu had no children.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.140
In her clan,

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.460
she was close only

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.380
to this niece.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.810
She knew her clan's power

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.940
had declined,

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.290
so she asked me to watch over Yong.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.530
Sadly,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.530
I was soon assigned to guard

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.380
the imperial mausoleum.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.940
I could only slip away at times

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.810
to teach him a few arts.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.050
I never thought

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.980
you would be so loyal and true,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.900
same as me.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.090
Sir,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.810
you're a fascinating one.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.810
The last time

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.220
you came to Tianqi City,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.940
I knew

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.250
one day,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.900
we'd be friends

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.900
or foes.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.090
Often,

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.980
friends or foes

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.620
are decided

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.050
in a single thought.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.940
Sir Zhuo Qing,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.090
will we be friends?

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.220
That depends

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.900
on what kind of friend you need.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.250
As I said,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.220
I'm the ferryman to the Other Shore.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.050
And right now...

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.900
I need a boat.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.570
No wonder you were once second

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.420
only to Mr. Li.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.660
I've seen qi freeze ice,

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.290
but never a single glance

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.380
freeze water itself.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.490
Su Changhe!

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.140
You spoke a name you shouldn't.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.220
Yes?

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.220
Yong

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.960
is the first prince.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.960
His mother's clan has faded,

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.050
but it's still one

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.400
of Tianqi's top five houses.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.660
Among the princes,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.200
only a few

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.940
are fit to rival him

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.900
for the heir-apparent's seat.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.140
Second Prince Xiao Chong

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.700
noble-born as well,

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.490
was known for his talent since childhood.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.290
Sadly,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.490
he was poisoned years ago,

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.470
and remains blind to this day.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:16.830
No one can cure him.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.930
The Seventh Prince Xiao Yu,

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.770
born to His Majesty's favorite consort,

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.730
was doted on since youth.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.090
But he's reckless and spoiled.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.900
The Shadow Sect behind him

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.770
was wiped out by you.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.980
The only real rival to Yong

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.290
is the sixth prince,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.250
Xiao Chuhe.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.460
Behind him stands

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.380
Prince of Langya, Xiao Ruofeng.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.290
Your opponent

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.860
is Prince of Langya?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.090
We're far

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.570
from the only one.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.770
He's too dazzling and too powerful.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.940
Worst of all,

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.010
he's far too proud.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.220
So,

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.140
almost all Tianqi City

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.700
sees him as their rival.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.290
The whole city?

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.900
Yes.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.530
His Majesty

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.380
must also be

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.900
losing sleep.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.010
Your Majesty,

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.420
what has happened?

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:56.770
It's nothing.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.570
I merely had a nightmare.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:03.570
Dreams

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.050
often run contrary.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.980
No need to worry, Your Majesty.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.620
I dreamed

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.700
I lay alone on a sickbed.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:14.980
Someone,

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.010
in armor,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.940
came to my bedside with a sword.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.250
He lifted the bed-curtain
