Chairman Du,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.920
it's a wonderful night.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.240
Do be sure to drink more.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.200
Chairman Du.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.120
Here's

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.560
to a fruitful partnership.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.200
Yamamoto,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400
you're being too formal.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.840
Chairman Du.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.360
I think

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.560
Ms. Man Li's had
a little too much to drink.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.120
She's a bit drunk.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.400
If you're worried,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.640
I can send her home.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.480
What do you say?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.920
You can send her home,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.440
but don't take advantage of her.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.720
Of course.

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:11.120
Ms. Man Li.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.360
Wake up.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.040
Go home and sleep it off.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.480
Easy now.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.600
Where's Musheng?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.090
He went to take a leak.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.000
The lazy will find
many excuses to avoid work.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.000
Boss.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.000
Where's Man Li?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.120
She drank too much.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.520
Yamamoto sent her home.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.160
He also gave a generous gift.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.480
We'll enjoy it later.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.800
What gift?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.490
You'll see when we get back.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200
Do you really like Zhou Musheng?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.960
A little.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.400
You know this.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.000
People like us

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
shouldn't get involved in relationships.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.200
What's more, Zhou Musheng's
with the North City Chamber of Commerce.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.040
He's unreliable.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.320
But Hong,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.800
I think he's different from the rest.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680
Different how?

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.840
Birds of a feather,
they're all the same.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.520
He's maybe just better looking.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.920
(Should I really not let myself
fall for him?)

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.760
Hong,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.440
I'm craving cake from Yangtze Hotel.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.480
Let's go buy some.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.360
You'll get fat.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.360
Hong, you're the best.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.320
You're such a handful.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.680
Oh, my little darling.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.640
You smell so nice.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.920
You're a feisty one.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.040
I like that.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.440
Oh, darling.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.160
We're almost there.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.600
Darling,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.640
we're here.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.640
Isn't that Man Li?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.080
I think it is.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.680
That man looks a lot like Yamamoto.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.200
What's she doing with him?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.280
Let's follow them.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.280
Come on.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.760
We're almost there.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.360
Don't worry. We'll be home in no time.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.320
Oh, darling!

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.560
I think

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.280
she's been drugged.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.840
Seems like it.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.000
After everything she did to you,
should we still help her?

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.840
Regardless,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.120
we can't let Yamamoto
take advantage of her.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.680
Come on.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.120
Ms. Man Li,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.440
you've finally

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.040
fallen into my hands.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.800
You wench!

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.240
How dare you hit me!

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.880
Excuse me.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200
I'd like to ask

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.720
about the room ahead…

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.200
Man Li. Man Li.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.880
(What exactly
did Yamamoto give as a gift?)

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.720
(No wonder Liu wasn't at dinner today.)

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.160
Hey.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.280
I haven't seen Liu all day.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.360
Where is he?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680
Is he not back yet?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.520
Oh.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.960
He went to Yamamoto's place.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.760
He's busy.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.240
To Yamamoto's? For what?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.160
Apparently,
Yamamoto prepared a hefty present.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.800
He went specifically to fetch it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.980
What exactly is the gift?

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.320
Oh,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.280
how should I know?

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.920
Just wait and see.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.640
Anything else?

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.080
If not, I'm going to the restroom.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.320
Zhou Musheng.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.200
The boss wants to see us.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.520
Coming.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.080
Spill it!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.800
Speak!

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.680
Answer me!

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.240
Speak!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.040
Or I'll kill you!

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.920
Mr. Yamamoto.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.480
The goods

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.120
you wanted are ready.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.080
They'll be delivered on time tomorrow.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.560
There's a mole inside

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.960
the North City Chamber of Commerce.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.280
Get Tan Fei to talk

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.560
and you'll know who it is.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.920
Talk.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.520
Who allowed you to take that shipment?

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.080
I don't know what you're talking about…

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440
Don't play dumb.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.480
To live

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.920
or die,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.160
the choice is yours.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.680
I don't know what to say…

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.840
Speak up! Say it!

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.280
Who's the mole?

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.560
Liu.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.400
Bring him in.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.920
What happened?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.720
There's a traitor among us…

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.080
You're both students.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.720
Get your buddy to talk.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.760
Tan Fei,

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.120
I can't stand this torture anymore.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.040
Stop holding out.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.160
Just tell them.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.840
Life will be easier.
