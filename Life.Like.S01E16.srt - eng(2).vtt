Tan Fei,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.040
Stop holding out.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.040
Just tell them.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.760
Life will be easier.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.920
Traitor.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.760
You're just a flyer boy.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.200
What do you even know?

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.000
An easier life, huh?

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.800
And you know better?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.880
Then talk!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.200
This isn't the place

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.920
to play hero.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.200
Stop dreaming.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.840
I can die,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.880
but I'll never sell anyone out.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.960
Still acting tough?

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.920
I'll make you…

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.480
Liu.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.920
Allow me.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.200
Go ahead.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.920
Teach him a lesson.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.040
Talk!

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.400
Talk!

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.240
Talk!

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.200
You're awake?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.480
Wait here.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.800
I'll get you something to eat.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.280
Mom…

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.200
Mom…

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.960
Get inside, quick!

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.880
Mom…

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.880
Shh.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920
No matter what happens,
don't make a sound.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.920
Don't come out.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.990
Take care of your sister.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.680
Mom…

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.400
Shh.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.600
Xu,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.440
I'm going to find some food.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.880
Wait here.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.520
I'll be right back.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.480
Okay.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.960
Come back soon.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.640
I'll be right here.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.760
I won't go anywhere.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.880
Xu!

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.000
Xu!

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.080
Xu!

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.720
(Xu,)

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.360
(is that you?)

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.160
Such a pretty face.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.200
Hit her!

00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:35.752
Have some porridge.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.000
Don't act all kind now.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.000
I don't need you
to meddle in my business.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.200
You need to eat
to have the strength to yell at me.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.040
I'll feed you.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.040
Eat.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.120
Cry if you want.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.000
You'll

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.520
feel better.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.240
Man Li…

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.760
Idiot! What are you doing in my bed?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.720
Idiot!

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.760
Get out!

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.680
Sleep a little more.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.960
Get up and put on my clothes.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.040
I need to go out.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.720
Where are you going?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.560
To Night Shanghai.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.520
Chairman Du.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.440
I think

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.280
Ms. Man Li's had
a little too much to drink.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.400
She's a bit drunk.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.600
If you're worried, I can send her home.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.280
You can send her home,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.000
but don't take advantage of her.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.200
(Du Hongyue.)

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.080
(My so-called master…)

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.520
- Ms. Man Li.
- Ms. Man Li.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.080
Get lost!

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.800
Du Hongyue, come out here!

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.400
Dad!

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:25.920
Hey.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.080
What's this?

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.120
Dad,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.840
this jade pendant's so pretty.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.400
It's our family heirloom.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.960
When you grow up and get married,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.480
I'll pass it to you. All right?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.080
Okay.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.480
(Du Hongyue,)

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.000
(so it was you!)

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.280
Tell us now,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.960
and maybe we might let you live.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.040
The mole is…

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.160
This is no good!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.680
He bit his tongue!

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.200
Quick! Pry his mouth open!

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.880
Get up!

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.360
Wake up!

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.320
Finish your sentence before you die!

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.200
Get him to the hospital.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.600
I want him alive.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.320
(Tan Fei's final words)

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.720
(revealed two things.)

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.920
(One,)

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.760
(he'd rather die than betray anyone.)

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.000
(Two,)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.720
(the mole knew nothing.)

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.680
(It was his final consolation,)

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.400
(and Zhou Musheng's
worst fear confirmed.)

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.240
Mr. Yamamoto.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.320
The goods

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.960
you wanted are ready.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.920
They'll be delivered on time tomorrow.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.160
Let me read your palm.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.320
