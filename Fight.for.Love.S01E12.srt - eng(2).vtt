I'll teach you how to massage

to gain abundant vital energy

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.310
you can press and lift, like this.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.520
As for the timing...

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.150
Tuantuan, press.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.240
Linyang, lift.

Tuantuan, press.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.590
Linyang, lift.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.270
How do you feel?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.840
So, Tuantuan...

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.430
Is it your nickname?

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.030
I...

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.080
Miss Song.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.150
Get up.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.750
Miss Song,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.800
are you alright?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.910
Just now, did I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.630
make a fool of myself?

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.870
Not at all.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.710
The way you slipped

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.400
reminded me of Yu

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.750
when she was a child.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.030
She often got into trouble.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.470
But just like you,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.310
she was adorable.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.630
General Chu,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.150
you look great when you're smiling.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.710
You should smile more.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.120
Staying in good spirits

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.310
will help you recover faster.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.200
I will.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.310
Miss Song...

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.470
General Chu,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.960
can you please

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.000
call me Tuantuan?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.710
Tuantuan?

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.750
Then from now on,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.120
I'll call you Linyang.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.870
Linyang, I should go.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.030
I'll escort you.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.870
No need.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.590
Shilan will come to get me.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.520
We had a deal.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.200
Linyang,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.430
goodbye.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.910
Since you inherited

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.710
and took over the Bureau,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.150
you must have been busy.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.800
Why do you have the time

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.600
to invite me over for fishing?

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.230
However busy I am,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.560
I need to meet someone important.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.350
Sit, please.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.190
You flatter me.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.440
Anyway, I don't

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.680
see your point.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.600
Without Yu,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.270
you and I

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.430
would never have even met.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680
I attended your banquet

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.270
also for her sake.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.590
What a coincidence.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.430
Today, I invited you over

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.680
for something

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.600
about Ms. Chu Yu.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.120
What will you do to her again?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.310
Please pay her no mind.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.750
I've spoiled her too much.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.390
Did she make trouble again

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.760
in your mansion?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.560
Well, Ms. Chu Yu

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.870
has indeed caused

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.000
some terrible trouble.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.430
She's reaching

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.600
for what's beyond her.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.680
But luckily, we share the same goal

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.680
for the same thing.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.680
What do you mean?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.430
Ms. Chu Yu and I

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.430
had a frank conversation.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.800
I also know she married my brother

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.720
to investigate the crossbow case.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.830
So, before Wei Jun died,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.920
he had told you

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.760
about that case.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.080
He trusted you.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.480
Before he died,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.360
he had promised you.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.000
I'll do that for him.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.160
Just now, you looked

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.630
really like him.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.790
Take this back.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.110
The crossbow

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.720
came from the Arsenal Bureau.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.480
They may have

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.830
some improvement methods,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.720
but no practical experience.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.560
I hope you will help them

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.240
to find a solution soon.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.790
If you stay silent,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.720
I'll take it as a yes.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120
Young Marquis,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.510
that's a big fish, indeed.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.460
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.760
Shilan.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.360
Why do you think

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.430
Linyang is such a nice man?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.680
He didn't blame me
when I did wrong acupuncture.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.540
He even offered

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.000
his arms for me

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.840
to practice on.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.520
Tuantuan.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.000
Since you left his mansion,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.680
you've been talking about him

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.720
all this time.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.510
Why don't you think about it?

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.560
Do you want to treat him,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.360
or do you just want to see him?

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.030
Have a good rest.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.520
My Lady,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.310
we've been out here for a while.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.190
How about we go back early?

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.240
Your brother just punished you.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.720
If he knows about it,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.840
he'll be angry again.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.430
I'm just taking a walk out here.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.310
Why would he be angry?

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.870
Chu Yu and I don't get along.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.600
But my brother wants us

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.440
to become close.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.630
It's not that easy.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.590
In the worst case,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.270
I'll just stop myself

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.600
from messing with her,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.440
alright?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.960
But My Lady,

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.870
my legs are sore from walking.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.270
If we don't go home,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.630
can we find somewhere

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.470
to take a break?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.000
Spring Breeze House, then.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.080
I can buy some cold noodles there.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.560
That's the food

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.410
your brother loves.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.360
Are you buying them for him?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.630
Who said that?

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.470
They're for me.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.600
Sorry, I was inconsiderate.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.510
It was thoughtless of me to give you

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.150
those ordinary willow chopsticks.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.150
These chopsticks are made of phoebe.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.920
Try them.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.390
Didn't you say Ms. Chu Jin

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.480
would often come here?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.510
Why haven't I even seen her once?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.050
Sir, look over there.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.600
Come on.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.270
Go invite her over.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.150
Hurry.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.990
Alright.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.200
Come in, please.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.750
Hi, Ms. Chu Jin.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.200
Mr. Song is there.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.110
This way, please.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.510
Miss,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.680
it'll be my treat.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.530
Come on, let's go.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.920
Ms. Chu Jin,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.960
we meet again.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.160
Sit, please.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.390
Ms. Chu Jin,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.230
are you unhappy?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.680
Yun,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.030
Madam Chu is here to see Yu.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.150
I know that, Chun.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.840
But Chu Yu is sick.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.480
I don't want her

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.360
to infect her mother.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.870
General Chu has only just recovered.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.840
If he catches something else,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.680
it would be terrible.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.480
Wanyue,

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.750
send those pastries

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.590
to Chu Yu.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.510
She loved them when she was little.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.870
Yes, Madam.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.440
Madam Chu, is there

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.280
anything else?

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.350
Yun.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.200
Madam Chu,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720
His Lordship

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.800
is straightforward.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.600
And he seldom receives female guests.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.910
Please don't mind him.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.390
It doesn't matter.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.320
I just want to ask.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.480
Some ladies here

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.600
got the Letter of Release

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.790
and went back home.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.750
I wonder what you plan

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.150
to do about my daughter?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.870
What is your opinion, Madam?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.200
I've heard

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.270
you often come here.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.320
So, these days,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.360
I came every day for you.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.590
For me?

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.750
Why?

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.670
Because I like you.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.080
Like me?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.440
Yeah. I like you.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.150
Mr. Song,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.120
don't you think I am mean?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.630
I said harsh things

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.630
at that banquet.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.200
Not at all.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.200
At the banquet,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.360
a lot of people thought

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.200
Yun would fail.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.990
It happens. I understand.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.590
Mr. Song.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.230
Do you really often visit
the Fragrance House?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.160
I...

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.960
I...

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.870
I was immature before.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.480
But I've totally changed.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.080
I won't go there anymore.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.910
Don't trust the Crown Prince.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.750
He lied about...

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.800
Anyway...

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.350
I mean, I swear

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.440
I won't go there again.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.270
Have I said something wrong?

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.030
Let me be frank.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.600
After that banquet,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.600
Young Master Sun set my sister up.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.550
Then my brother Linyang

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.750
blamed it all on me.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.480
In their eyes,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.120
I'm a lady

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.480
who is spoiled and unruly.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.990
But that day,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.320
I cut it off with him

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.240
right away.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.120
Whenever it's about my sister,

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.360
Linyang becomes irrational.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.360
They never understand me.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.000
Don't undervalue yourself.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.440
In my eyes,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.840
you're the most lovely lady

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.000
in this world.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.710
Then tell me.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.960
What's good about me?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.440
You...

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.080
You are...

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.960
Well, you...

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.960
I understand.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.840
You and I only met once.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.000
It's normal if you stammer.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.390
No, no, no.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.800
That's not true.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.320
Think about it.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.360
You made a timely break

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.320
with Young Master Sun.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.160
What does that mean?

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.670
It means you're sensible.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.960
Besides,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.960
you can face your true feelings.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.390
So, you're brave.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.910
A clever, brave,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.720
and pretty woman like you

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.800
is wonderful.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.870
Look, look.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.150
You have a nice smile.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.000
Everything about you is wonderful.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.720
Why would General Chu not like you?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.360
Mr. Song,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.150
you make me feel better.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.200
Mr. Song,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.200
this is today's bill. Please check.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.040
Alright.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.040
Wait.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.710
Waiter,

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.090
it must be a wrong bill.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.840
The dishes should be worth four taels.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.670
Why is it five here?

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.480
Mr. Song,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.960
don't come here anymore.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.840
Every time you're here,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.510
I guess you pay more than you deserve.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.200
Oh, come on.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.630
Luckily, Ms. Chu Jin saw through it.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.000
How dare you overcharge me?

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.150
I'm rich.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.160
But you can't rob me.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.600
Mr... Mr. Song...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.840
Don't say that.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.360
It must be the accountant's fault.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.960
I'll go back there

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.800
for a recalculation.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.350
Sorry, sorry.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.270
Thank you, Ms. Chu Jin.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.870
I've heard you do well

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.000
in accounting.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.160
If someone

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.480
can marry you,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.630
I'm sure you will

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.080
arrange everything perfectly.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.200
Come on.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.440
Have some food.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.230
Here.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.600
Your mother has come.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.200
What's your decision?

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.600
What is your plan?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.840
Before, you offered me

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.870
the Letter of Release.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.150
What's gone is gone.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.070
Now, it's different.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.080
Rationally speaking,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.840
I want you to leave.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:12.760
If you suspect anyone,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:13.870
I can cooperate.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.630
But...

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.240
But I think

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.510
you should decide

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.400
what you want to do.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.750
Rationally speaking,

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.480
it's true.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.920
Staying here is

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.070
more convenient for me to take action.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.200
And you saw my mother.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.200
If I'm back home,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.310
there will be much inconvenience.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.510
So, I want to stay here.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.680
I can help to rebuild this family.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.200
You're going to be a general

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.680
whose name will go down in history.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.560
What do you say,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.910
Your Lordship?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.680
Will you let me stay

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.790
and work with you?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.750
From what I just heard,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.160
you and your mother aren't close.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.920
But she seemed to be trying hard

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.110
to bridge the gap.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.000
My mother and I...

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.240
When my father mediated,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.680
things weren't too bad.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.280
But now...

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.720
You have me.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720
You need to rest

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.390
for your injuries.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.070
Will you stop moving around?

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.390
And you.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.310
Will you stop getting in

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.280
as you please?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.920
What?

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.200
Now, you don't care

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.200
about our relationship?

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.790
You're not my real sister-in-law.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.110
We can pretend in public.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.920
But in private, don't tease me.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.960
It's so late.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.440
I wonder if Yu is asleep.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.680
I don't think so.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.190
Be careful.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.000
Yu.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.670
Are you asleep?

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.400
Lan and I

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.680
have come with some herbs.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.950
Why?

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.440
What do you think?

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.160
If they see

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.520
a man like me

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.480
staying in your room so late,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.480
it will be terrible.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.190
I...

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.790
You go tell them

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.830
that you're asleep.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.910
What?

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.150
You're scared?

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.310
Don't give that kind of look.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.280
What do you want?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.030
I wonder

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.920
if she's getting better.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.920
The physician said

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.200
the herbs were very effective.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.750
Why is there no reply?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.590
Where did Wanyue go?

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.280
Let's go take a look.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.070
So it's you, ladies.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.350
I thought I was dreaming.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.110
Are you feeling any better?

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.440
Here are some herbs for you.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.510
Let me bring them in.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.350
No need.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.440
I think I've caught a cold.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.280
Don't get in, or I may infect you.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.590
If the children are sick,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.430
that will be bad.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.520
That's right.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.880
Then, tomorrow,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.070
we'll come and see you.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.630
Alright.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.560
Go to bed early.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.510
- Rest early.
- Go.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.350
Let's go.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.240
Tell me.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.440
What else do you need to say?

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.350
Today,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.240
I told your big brother everything

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.720
and returned the mechanism.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.520
You no longer need

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.070
to worry about him.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.920
The point is...

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.760
Look at this.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.830
A clue about the man

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.670
behind Wei Tongfeng.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.590
Lu Qiba helped us figure it out.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.510
He's quite helpful.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.140
(Yao Yong may have bribed Wei Tongfeng.)

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.040
Yao Yong?

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.160
I remember that General Yao Yong

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.400
was just like my father.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.880
They both advanced

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.160
by fighting in battles.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.960
He followed Lord of Qin.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.920
That year, we lost three towns.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.440
Without his defense,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.030
Qingzhou would have fallen

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:30.870
into the North Qi's hands.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:33.960
Lord of Qin?

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.660
(Details of Wei Tongfeng's Case)

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.390
What's wrong?

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.030
I remember Gu Chusheng told me

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.480
there were hidden details

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:44.880
of Lord of Qin's treason.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.240
If that's true,

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.920
is Yao Yong getting revenge?

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.830
Why is Gu Chusheng involved again?

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.240
His family was sentenced to execution

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.550
due to that case.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.030
My father went into the palace overnight

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:03.920
to meet His Majesty

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.270
and kept Gu Chusheng alive.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.840
Never mind.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.400
He does not have to help

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.310
investigate Yao Yong.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.670
Right.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.720
We don't rely on him.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.640
The Yao family.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.000
Someone in that family

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.400
may be able to help us.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.100
(Yao Mansion)

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.030
General,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.070
Wei Tongfeng was exposed.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.310
The other day, Wei Yun

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.510
killed him in the Bureau.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.620
(Impatience will ruin big plans.)

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.480
He's dead?

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.680
Good.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.270
Wei Tongfeng

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.790
sold the secrets of the Arsenal Bureau

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.350
and committed treason.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.350
He deserves to be killed.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.680
But what if they trace it back

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.160
to you?

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.790
When we do something,

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.590
we're ready for possible exposure.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.440
But sadly,

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.920
why was his cover

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.440
blown so soon?

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.200
Our preparations

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.510
aren't sufficient yet.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.070
I will go

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.590
and deal with all the people

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.430
related to him.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.160
You're the one most closely involved.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.870
General.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.510
I'll clean up.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.350
And General,

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.550
a letter was for Lady Jue

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.310
from the Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.790
These days, I've been so busy

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.200
that I have neglected

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.440
my cousin Yao Jue.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.310
It's getting cold.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.960
Don't forget

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.590
to give her some clothes.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.040
Yes.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.380
(Yao Yong is colluding
with the North Qi.)

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.620
(Please come back and help us.)

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.270
My cousin

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.510
is colluding with the North Qi.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.800
Lady Jue,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.800
General summoned you.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.000
Cousin.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.440
How dare you?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.840
Kneel.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.680
Jue is my cousin.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.310
After she was divorced,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.750
she moved in here.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.790
But what did you do?

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.680
You didn't take care of her properly.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.920
Look at her clothes

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.760
and her jewels.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.000
She isn't as decent

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.840
as she should be.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.310
Ignorant people

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.440
may think

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.790
I've been mistreating her.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.400
Don't be angry, General.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.590
Sorry for the improper care.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.680
Calm down, cousin.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.310
He offered me

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.590
a lot of things.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.960
I don't like to dress up,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.240
so I'm not wearing any.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.800
Come on.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.310
With very low desire,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.560
you've been kind.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.000
Since she pleaded for you,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.840
I'll let you go.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:13.980
- Get out.
- Yes.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:18.830
Just a misunderstanding.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.910
Come on.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:22.920
These days,

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.960
I've been too busy

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.830
to care about you.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.110
Sorry for that.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.630
Sit.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.510
Earlier, I had my cook

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.550
make this tonic soup.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.920
And I'm here to apologize.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.790
I'm immensely grateful

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.400
when you take me in, cousin.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.270
We're bonded in blood.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.000
No need for formalities.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.720
Here. Taste it.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.000
Thank you, cousin.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.800
How is it?

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.000
Pretty delicious, huh?

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.000
This soup is called

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.510
"Mother-child Soup".

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.830
A hen and her chick were killed

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.590
and stewed for two hours.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.040
So,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.200
it's delicious.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.920
Luckily, chickens don't have feelings.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.830
They don't know

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.510
a mother will usually die

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.750
together with her child.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.760
For example,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.720
you're living here.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.550
If this family falls,

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.030
you won't be able to get away.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.480
If I'm in trouble,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.240
I will certainly kill your kid

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.000
who stays in the Wei family.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.350
Jue,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.070
think carefully about it.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.110
No.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.590
A clever woman

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.000
knows what to choose.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.920
But what if she loses her mind?

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.030
Jue, you've been very clever.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.440
I don't think you'll let me down.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.070
Xiaoxiao.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.910
My Lady.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.770
Xiaoxiao.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:09.980
- Hurry.
- My Lady.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.510
Write a letter to Chu Yu.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.400
Tell her with the divorce paper,

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.920
I'm no longer a Mrs. Wei

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.680
and I have nothing to do with them.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.560
Tell her not to contact me anymore.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.880
Yes, My Lady.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.580
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.220
(Youban Pavilion)

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.920
Your Highness, what's bothering you?

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.280
Tell us about it

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.000
and we can share your burden.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.200
I took a fancy

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.350
to my brother's bucket of pearls.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.590
Usually, he gave me

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.920
whatever I wanted.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.200
But today, he demanded
an exorbitant price.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.200
He asked me for 100,000 taels.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.280
A hundred thousand?

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.280
A hundred thousand?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.960
That's too much.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.270
And I actually know

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.960
the pearls aren't worth this much.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.510
But they're really dazzling.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.680
They're one of a kind.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.070
So, I gather you here,

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.240
expecting you to think

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.920
how I can get the pearls

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.030
with the least money

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.070
or even with no money.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.550
Your Highness, you can tell me

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.000
where the pearls are.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.240
I will get them

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240
for you,

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:08.590
unnoticed.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.750
One of my followers

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.960
could steal something

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.030
from His Majesty.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.160
Are you trying to get me killed?

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.270
I didn't mean that.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.390
Your Highness,

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.480
as far as I know,

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.240
the tax revenue for this city

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.110
last year

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.350
was 100,000 taels.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.400
So, I think

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.840
His Majesty wants

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.310
a good plan to enrich

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.150
our treasury.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.910
In my opinion,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.030
even if you gave away all your money

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.750
for the treasury,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.720
it was only a temporary solution.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.440
The permanent solution

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.830
is to increase taxes

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.510
or add surtaxes.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.750
Our nation has been at war.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200
Since the Baidi Valley battle,

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.680
people haven't restored their lives.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.190
Increased taxes

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.680
will only make them wail.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.680
Why would they complain

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.800
about doing their part?

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.920
Even you know

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.680
our treasury is strained.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.750
How much money do commoners have?

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.830
Don't spend their money.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.750
That's a lame idea.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:15.550
Mr. Xue,

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.550
you sound so righteous.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.350
Do you have any good ideas?

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.520
We use the much

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.920
to make up for the little.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.350
Commoners are poor.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.750
But in Huajing City,

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.550
many people live an extravagant life.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.240
We can't force them,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.350
but they can donate.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.440
If we can get the nobles

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.310
in Huajing City

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.920
to donate to the treasury,

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:36.390
the problem

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.680
will be readily solved.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.680
You're clever, Hanmei.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.160
That's really hit

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.310
a chord with me.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.920
You go back and think

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.830
of a logical way for me

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.240
get enough money

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.400
from the nobles.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.560
Yes.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.880
I'm thinking.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.160
Jue cares so much about Lingmo.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.680
How could she

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.790
say something so cruel?

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.720
Let's ignore if she's like that.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.790
I'm worried...

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.270
I know your point.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.280
Yao Yong must have

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.030
set his sights on Jue.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.240
In that case,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.070
we'll try another way

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.080
to search his house.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.440
Lingmo,

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.400
wait for me.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.790
You eat too slowly, Lingchun.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.000
I won't wait for you.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.850
I'm going to school.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:45.720
- Lingmo.
- Slowly.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.680
Don't run so fast again.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.520
Understand?

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.550
It's you, Uncle and Auntie.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.440
Auntie, are you getting better?

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.680
I wanted to see you,

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.200
but Auntie Chun stopped me.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.750
What did you

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.590
want me for?

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.070
Can you give this painting

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.000
to my mother?

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.440
I miss her.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.590
Lingmo,

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.830
if you miss your mother,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.350
you can see her.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.720
All you need to do...

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:21.870
What is it?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.310
Tell me, Auntie.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.270
All you need to do

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.880
is go to school

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.750
and get As in all subjects.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.440
Then, I'll take you to see your mother.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.040
That's easy. It's a deal, then.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.160
Lingchun,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.680
let's go to school.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.510
Uncle, Auntie,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.530
we're going to school.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.410
- Alright.
- Go.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.800
Be careful.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.590
Oh, I see.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.310
She must be concerned

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.150
about Lingmo.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.350
So, she can't help us.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.280
In that case,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.920
we have to leave it at that.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.560
That makes sense.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.070
I'll ask Wei Qiu to watch on Yao Mansion

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.720
and protect Jue.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.760
What's so funny?

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.880
You're tough but sweet.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.740
Your Lordship, My Lady,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.160
Mr. Gu is here.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.840
Who's he asking for?

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.760
Me?

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.870
She won't see him.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:36.950
That's right.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.030
I won't see him.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.360
Mr. Gu said

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.550
he knew you would say so.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.190
So, he asked to see the two of you.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.220
(True Might)

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.510
Mr. Gu, what do you want?

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.030
It's impolite of you

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.150
to come here alone

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.760
and see my sister-in-law.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.710
And now you don't say anything.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.440
What are you up to?

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.320
Your residence is so deserted.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.840
So, wouldn't you even

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.150
serve some tea for your colleague?

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.950
Wanyue.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.710
Some tea for our guest.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.240
Yes.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.440
Don't be reserved

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.760
in front of Wen Yun.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.320
We keep no secrets.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.510
Tell me

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.960
what you want.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.440
So, he also knows

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.150
why you married his brother.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.390
Like she said,

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.150
we keep no secrets.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.880
What else concerns you now?

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.670
If you keep us guessing,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.840
I don't think you need the tea.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.510
Chu Yu,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.280
may I speak in private?

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.400
What must you keep

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.240
from His Lordship?

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.030
The Lord of Qin's treason

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.670
is closely connected

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.670
to your investigation.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.800
Now, may we speak in private?

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.840
The North Qi has a long plan.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.360
During the Lord of Qin's treason,

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.670
they planned

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.360
to annex our nation.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.760
The decline of our national power

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.840
is an indisputable fact.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.920
For such a big plan,

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:10.760
there must be places

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.880
in Huajing City,

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.670
even the whole nation

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.510
where they meet.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.400
In the Court of Judicial Review,

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.110
I've reviewed all the records

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.000
and found out these places.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.510
Hope they'll be helpful.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:27.910
Chu Yu,

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.510
I know you don't trust me.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.320
If I hadn't retaken the exam,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.960
I couldn't have joined

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.900
the Court of Judicial Review.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.440
Nor could I

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.150
vindicate my family someday.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.360
I know you hate

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.200
and detest me.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.590
I shouldn't have come to you.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.400
But I didn't expect this.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:50.880
The Wei family, your family,

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.230
and even my family

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.480
are messed up together.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.880
I got these files for you.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.710
I can also help you figure out

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:02.960
how your father died.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.440
Can you trust me once more?

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.440
Does an experienced scholar

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.550
always think a prodigal is precious?

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.160
But why do I feel

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.550
such a prodigal
should be kicked to the curb?

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.360
His repentance

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.760
is worthless.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.640
Yu,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.190
what I told you the other day

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.280
was true.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.030
When I was exiled,

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.230
my mind was in turmoil.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440
So, I failed you.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.030
Your hatred

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.800
is what I deserve.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.760
If I could start over, I would...

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.230
Start over?

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.550
I've shown enough respect,

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.590
haven't I?

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.710
She's my sister-in-law.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.420
What nonsense is that?

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.440
You managed to come in and see her

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.000
only because you're an official.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.840
If you were just a commoner,

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.400
you would be lucky

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.710
if I didn't kick you out.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:08.950
Enough.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.120
Gu Chusheng,

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.800
I told you it was too late.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.200
I did mean that.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.640
And...

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.280
Wen Yun and I

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.120
have got some clues

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.510
about our case.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.360
You have a point.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.360
But I believe

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.440
I will regain

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.110
your trust.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.150
Your master is right.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.630
Someone like Gu Chusheng

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.550
should have been kicked out.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.430
What?

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.000
You're finally admitting

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.840
he has a point.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:03.030
You never played nice to him,

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.400
did you?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.360
Today, your master

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.280
did reasonably well.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.550
He sided with Her Ladyship.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.670
So, I endorsed him.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.840
My Lord,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.000
did they give you a hard time?

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.550
He clearly has a motive towards her.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:32.800
Just now,

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.480
weren't you being too impulsive?

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.070
I've always hated him.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.070
Even if you're strangers now,

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.390
what he did you

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.400
will never be forgotten.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:46.510
Just now, I should

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.400
have punched him.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.840
If you did,

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.960
you'd lose your cool.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.510
If I wanted revenge,

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.000
I can do a million things

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.000
to set him up.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.110
But we don't have time for that.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.620
(Qinxi Valley,
Bitao Villa, Wangyu Manor)

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.670
Qinxi Valley?

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.600
Exactly.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.190
It's owned by the Eldest Princess.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.000
Maybe we can start from there.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.920
I trust you, Chu Yu.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.880
You will find a way out.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.710
Her Highness cares about this nation.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.230
How would she allow anyone

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.230
to use her own place?

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.400
Can there be something fishy

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.760
about her followers?

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.030
What do you want?

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.030
What do I want?

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.550
You made a showy display

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.960
and none of us had a chance

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.550
to speak up.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.550
I'll teach you a lesson.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.800
A newcomer like you might not know.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.440
These are not

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.800
ordinary plants.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.510
They're different poisons.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.110
Some can even kill you.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.670
Don't try to scare me.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.330
These are just

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.360
common weeds.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.070
How can that be?

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.510
Don't worry too much.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.440
You won't be tortured too long.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:41.910
Within three days,

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.000
you'll fester and die.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.510
It won't itch anymore.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.640
I'm sorry.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.720
I'm so sorry.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.760
I'm new here

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.600
and I'm naughty.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.920
I won't mess with you anymore.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.200
Can I have the antidote?

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.200
I don't want to die.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.400
Apology accepted.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.110
You were right.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.760
These are just ordinary plants.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.110
Take a bath with some bath cream.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.680
You won't die.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.390
You...

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:17.840
How could he be

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.880
so malicious?

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.000
It itches. It really does.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.200
Ms. Chu,

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:29.590
aren't you coming out

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:30.910
after seeing the fun?

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:37.320
How did you know I was here?

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.510
I thought I was hidden perfectly.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.440
Not everyone could have found me.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.710
I didn't know

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.760
you were so perceptive.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:03.110
Oh, I see.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.280
I was thoughtless.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.150
But Mr. Xue,

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.710
how did you know it was me?

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.550
Few people in town

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.280
would dare to break

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.320
in here like this.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.800
The intruder

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:18.510
sat there and watched for a while.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.600
I thought about it.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.000
No one but you

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.920
would do something

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:24.000
so sneaky.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.030
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.760
You came here so late at night.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.000
Is there an emergency?

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:34.880
Do I have to inform Her Highness?

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.840
I wouldn't have climbed the wall

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.880
to see Her Highness.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.320
Isn't it inappropriate?

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.800
Why is it inappropriate?
