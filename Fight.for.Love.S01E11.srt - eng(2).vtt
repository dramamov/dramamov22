(Tong)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.200
I'm Wei Shuo, deputy general

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.040
of the Bureau.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.400
Commander Lu is with a visitor.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
Not sure when he's free.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.760
If you can wait,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.120
wait in the reception room.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.790
No problem.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.950
His Lordship ordered me

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.800
to see Commander Lu today.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.000
I will wait,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.840
whatever it takes.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.710
Alright. Come this way.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.140
(Arsenal Bureau)

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.590
We're responsible

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.120
for the entire process of weapons

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.280
from design to production.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.150
So, civil and military officials

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.520
all eat and sleep here.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.520
So,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.520
it's crowded.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.150
At court,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.590
those officials are adversarial.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.030
- They've never cooperated.
- Again.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.360
How ironic.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.920
Didn't get enough to eat? Again.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.120
That's the location

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.960
on the blueprint.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.200
Be careful.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.710
You can stop here.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.750
Be careful.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.360
- Alright.
- Done. There you go.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.640
Next.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.920
Alright.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.990
- Is that it?
- Was it modified?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.520
Is it here?

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.840
All we need now is this.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.240
Alright. Put it here.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.750
Here we are.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.800
You stay here

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.640
and wait.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.430
Thank you.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.840
Commander Lu,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.590
I took her to the reception room,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.030
as directed.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.630
Since when do we

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.870
have another reception room?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.520
Different guests

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.520
are received in different rooms.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.910
The woman who came here today

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.280
is the dancer at Fragrance House, right?

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.960
Young Marquis,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.360
you're too generous.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.030
Using our resources to please a woman.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.280
I'm impressed, really.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.710
How did you recognize her?

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.360
The beauty of a woman

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.470
does not lie entirely in her face.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.240
Women have their own charm

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.750
with different shapes.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.310
And I have my own way

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.600
to appreciate them.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.440
Lu Qiba,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.070
watch your mouth.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.830
Irritated?

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.190
Before she's even yours,

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.560
you're already defending her.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.360
Young Marquis,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
since when are you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.950
such a romantic?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.400
Lu Qiba,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.750
we have a mole here.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.830
When I plant a pawn,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.830
someone will take action.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.870
It does not conflict

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.710
with our cooperation.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.070
Young Marquis,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.560
you are wrong

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.150
about one thing.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.000
You're in the Arsenal Bureau,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.920
but it doesn't mean

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.680
you can exceed your duty

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.310
and make decisions for me

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.600
in this place.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.870
It seems you have

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.270
more faith in your sweetheart,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.040
than in me,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.430
the deputy commander.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So...

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.040
I will let you do

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.360
as you wish.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.300
(Loyalty, Marshal)

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.150
Wei Yun

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.070
just became the Marquis of Zhenguo

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.720
and got the Fish-shaped Tally.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.830
Then, he couldn't wait

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.480
to have our bureau investigated.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.600
Do you know

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.430
why he's doing this?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.240
Umm...

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.830
Alright.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.920
I won't keep you guessing.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
According to him,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.120
the octagonal crossbow's blueprint

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.390
we previously discarded

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.310
was in the hands of the North Qi army.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.270
North Qi?

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.680
How is that possible?

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.360
He suspects that someone in our bureau

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.750
stole the blueprint

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.430
and committed treason.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.270
Treason?

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.600
- Yeah.
- How is that possible?

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.920
And I,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.600
Lu Qiba,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.430
is the traitor

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.680
they have identified.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.480
- No way.
- That's impossible.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.560
- Impossible.
- Yeah.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.000
You aren't like that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.240
Yeah. You aren't that kind of person.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.360
That's nonsense.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.600
Exactly.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.830
Besides, the crossbow's design

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.750
was abandoned long ago.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.000
Even in that case,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.830
he should have sold a new blueprint.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.310
Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.040
He wouldn't sell anything.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.720
Alright.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.710
Yeah.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.830
Wen Yun is terrible.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.720
How could he accuse me of that?

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.560
How would I possibly

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.870
be the traitor?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.360
So, I argued with him

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.240
and locked him up in the secret room.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.000
I need

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.120
to get to the bottom of this.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.160
Otherwise, all of us

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.190
may suffer

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.120
what happened twenty years ago.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.070
Let's investigate, then.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.120
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.070
That's right, Commander.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.160
We will fully cooperate with you.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.720
Before this case

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.270
is thoroughly investigated,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.240
no one shall

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.600
release Wei Yun

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.480
for any reason

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.430
unless I approve.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960
Yes, Commander.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.350
Wei Yun?

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.310
Why are you here?

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.150
I...

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.470
Catch her.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.390
I've got something to look into.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.480
But I promise you.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.670
What I'm doing

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.120
won't harm you or your family.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.510
You stole the Fish-shaped Tally

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.600
and broke in here under my name.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600
Why should I trust you?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.320
What on earth are you up to?

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.270
Still trying to escape?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.720
What if I am?

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.200
I thought about explaining it.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.480
But even if I told you,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.120
you still wouldn't help, right?

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.110
Watch out.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.040
You...

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.910
Why are you still alive?

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.600
Young Marquis Wei is blessed.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.270
He would not die

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.720
before a traitor like you.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.390
Besides,

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.750
his sweetheart is here.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.120
With a great helper,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.360
he must be lucky.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.480
This is the power of love.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.710
Commander Lu.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.480
Your Lordship.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.600
Spare me, Your Lordship.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.870
Wei Yun.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.480
This isn't over

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.120
between you and me.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.270
After I deal with Wei Tongfeng,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.080
I'll come back to you.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.480
Young Marquis,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.360
can't you tell me

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.600
what you're really up to?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.150
I told you,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.230
she and I

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.990
aren't together.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.720
Wei Tongfeng,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.600
under such circumstances,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.480
do you still not confess?

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.320
I don't know

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.240
what you mean.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.630
Like I said,

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.960
what I did today

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.750
as directed by Commander Lu.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.840
It's Commander Lu

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.600
who should be punished.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.360
Did he also order you

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.960
to kill me?

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.000
Earlier, he told everyone

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.320
that I accused him of treason

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.240
and he locked me up out of anger.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.150
A loyal man

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.120
would fully assist him

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.030
in an investigation

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.000
to prove his innocence.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.870
But you did the opposite.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.960
Because you have a guilty conscience.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.870
You think when I'm killed,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.960
the investigation will go nowhere.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.870
Even if it's exposed someday,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.720
Lu Qiba will be

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.840
your scapegoat.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.360
It's a plan to kill two birds
with one stone.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.550
How could you not be tempted?

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.750
Do you know what you deserve

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.360
as a traitor like that?

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.240
So what if I'm the traitor?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.080
Wei Yun,

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.600
you dare not kill me.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.120
You can't kill me, either.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:40.750
If you kill me,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.320
you will never know

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.840
who bribed me.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.080
I'm not interested

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.550
in your confession.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.360
Even without you,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.390
I can still find out the truth.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.390
You're not in any position
to threaten me.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.510
Hey, man.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.030
You're just going to leave?

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.710
Come on.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.550
Under no circumstances can you

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.360
leave me with a dead body.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.200
What am I supposed to do?

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.230
I have things to do.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.240
You're the deputy commander.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.440
You're in charge

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.110
of the rest.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.840
What are you going to do?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.000
To get a wife?

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.990
I...

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.270
Wei Shuo.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.110
Take care of this.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.360
I'll go see the fun.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.550
Your pawn is quite something.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.960
She managed to escape.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.000
How did she open that?

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.710
Wait for me.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.790
(I can't give in)

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.480
(unless I have to.)

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.510
My Lady,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.510
you didn't take me again.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.960
I didn't want you to worry.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.840
Come on.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.870
Don't frown.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.150
Our cover is blown.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.840
Wei Yun knows what I've been up to.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.630
Good, then.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.440
Let's leave here.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.960
Leave?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.750
Then, our efforts will be wasted.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.960
I think he's interrogating Wei Tongfeng

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.120
and won't be back soon.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.800
Don't worry.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.080
As long as I keep denying it,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.390
he can't do anything to me.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.600
How about

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.120
I get a physician to check on you?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.030
No need.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.960
I have no time for that.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.600
I need a solution to today's crisis.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.600
Otherwise,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.630
my family will get stuck.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.840
I have to rely

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.510
on Wei Yun's morals.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.390
Wei Yun?

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.750
Is it appropriate for you

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.590
to come in so late?

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.590
Chu Yu,

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.720
shall I praise you for being fearless

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.320
or scold you for being bold?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.510
I'm indeed impressed.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.670
How dare you run away from the Bureau

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.360
and come back here?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.080
- You...
- Wanyue.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.390
Go out and close the door.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.600
He came so late at night.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.030
He must want to tell me

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.960
something private.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.910
Don't let others see.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.110
What?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.960
You want to confront me, right?

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:32.840
Why are you silent?

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.110
Scared?

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.510
Watch out!

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.110
Chu Yu.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.120
Now, we're even.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.590
Play dead.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.550
Just now, you saved my life.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.880
I don't want to fight you now.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.310
You have a chance

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.240
to explain everything.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.310
I don't owe you a thing.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.880
Even if I'm up to something,

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.480
it must be something righteous.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.590
Even if you push me,

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.680
I won't explain anything.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.160
The mechanism of the crossbow.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.520
Why do you

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.920
have this mechanism?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
You know that crossbow?

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.070
Then, you must know

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.310
it's an invention of the Arsenal Bureau.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.070
This one is from the North Qi.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.880
My father and brother risked for it.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.070
I gave it to...

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.720
Wei Jun gave it to you?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.070
Before my big brother died,

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.270
he gave me this mechanism.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.000
But he didn't mention

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.110
it was from you.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.880
You knew from the start

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.110
about the mole in your bureau.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.880
So, you let me

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.000
take the Fish-shaped Tally

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.960
and wanted to use me

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.160
to uncover that mole.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.880
You were using me.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.200
I used you. That's true.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:28.630
But Chu Yu,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.840
since the first day

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.830
you came to this family,

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.000
how many times have you used me?

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.480
I had it all planned out,

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.510
except for Wei Jun.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.200
I didn't know he would tell you.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.110
In your eyes,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.960
I must look ridiculous.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.510
Chu Yu, I can't figure you out.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.960
So, I don't know

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.440
why you believe my big brother

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.310
but don't believe me.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.400
Why should I believe you?

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.590
Your sword

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.440
has been at my throat

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
since the moment

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.400
I came to this family.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.440
Why should I believe you?

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.960
Why should I bet my life

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.800
on someone like you?

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.110
All right, then.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.590
I don't want to continue this.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.480
Nor do I want to stay

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.590
in your mansion.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.840
Congratulations.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.320
You win.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.550
(I gave it my all.)

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.080
(But in the end,)

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.960
(it was pretty much worthless.)

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:55.940
(By Wei Jun)

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.590
(Chu Yu,)

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.030
(since you've made a decision,)

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.510
(how could you easily give up?)

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.160
You've been living here this whole time.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.240
How do you not know about this letter?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.510
Entrusted by Ms. Chu,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.030
we'll investigate the leak
in the Arsenal Bureau.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.440
Concerning some secrets,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.720
it will be perilous.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.830
Though Ms. Chu is as excellent as men,

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.400
men in our family
should bear the responsibility.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.400
But in the coming battle,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.160
I don't know if I can survive.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.400
If I fail to come back alive,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.720
whoever finds this letter

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.640
should obey my last wish

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.680
and give a hand

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.720
to Ms. Chu.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.440
Maybe I have done

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.750
too many bad things in the past.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.790
When I showed kindness,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:30.790
I got my comeuppance.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.790
Had I known

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.960
about this letter,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.400
I didn't have to end up like this.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.390
Mr. Wei Jun.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.040
I'm sorry.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.880
Trust is a two-way thing.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.030
It's true that you suspected me.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.440
I also made unfair assumptions.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.070
But the crossbow case

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.920
involves too much.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.790
Wei Tongfeng is merely

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.790
an abandoned pawn.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.400
If I agree

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.510
to be honest with you,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.550
will you

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:55.790
stay in my family

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.030
and investigate it with me?

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.550
What if I don't accept

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.510
your apology?

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.510
If you don't,

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.160
I'll be waiting here.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.270
Until you accept it.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.430
You...

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.670
Chu Yu. Chu Yu.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.840
Chu Yu.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.760
It hurts.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.430
It hurts.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.040
Don't.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.200
Don't let anyone know it.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.280
Don't.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.080
Rest assured.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.070
I won't tell anyone.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.240
I will take good care

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.200
of Her Ladyship.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.920
Your Lordship,

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.440
what else do you command?

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.670
Take care of her.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.310
If you need anything,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.160
ask Wei Qiu for it.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.040
These days,

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.070
I gave her a hard time.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.440
You finally sound nice.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.160
I'll come to see her tomorrow.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.590
What happened?

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.830
Why did she faint

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.310
for no reason?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.840
Has he left?

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.960
You were pretending?

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.110
When I was out there,

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.510
I was so worried.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.750
If I hadn't pretended to faint,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.030
I wouldn't know

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.510
how to continue just now.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.350
Alright.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.510
Next time, I'll signal you in advance.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.520
Is it alright?

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.910
Don't be angry.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.750
Lie back there.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.510
Otherwise, your wound

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.350
will bleed again.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.790
Let me see.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.240
I'm fine.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.960
I just don't understand.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.310
Why do you have to avoid him like that?

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.440
We can't be too careful.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.440
Who knows

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.030
if he decided to work with me

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.510
because he read Wei Jun's letter

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.160
and had a momentary impulse?

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.680
Anyway,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.720
I need to take advantage of this family

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.240
to investigate the crossbow case.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.720
Wei Yun and I

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.960
are inherently unequal.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.960
What if he regrets it someday

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.510
and decides to discard me?

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.320
That makes sense.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.510
But even if he regrets it someday...

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.000
Recently...

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.510
At least recently,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.030
he won't cast me aside.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.720
Just now, he made me faint.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.270
If he wants to expel me,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.240
won't he feel guilty?

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.920
Oh, I've learned that.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.270
It's always so wise of you.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.550
You're being tactical.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.790
Have a good rest.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.200
You've had a tough time.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.100
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.070
Very good.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:35.960
The more you eat,

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.000
the sooner you'll recover.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.050
Would you like

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:38.960
another bowl of it?

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.190
Your Lordship, wait for me.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.480
I want no more.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:44.590
You...

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.790
Go out and tell them

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.630
I'm still in bed

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.470
and haven't woken up.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.200
It's so early.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:54.070
Wei Qiu,

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.200
why are you shouting?

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.510
If you wake her up,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.000
I'll hit you.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:59.670
Your Lordship.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.750
How is she now?

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.200
Thank you for your concern.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.920
She's doing much better.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.160
But she isn't awake yet.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.280
Let her sleep, then.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.110
I just don't know

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.030
what she likes.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.270
So, I've prepared

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.320
some food and toys.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.270
When she wakes up,

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.030
please tell her.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.200
Yesterday, I caught her in the act,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.350
but I didn't expect her to be hurt.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.400
I want to apologize.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.070
When I finish

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.160
today's work in the Bureau,

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.680
I will explain everything

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.670
to General Chu.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.680
And I will keep investigating

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.550
the rest of the case.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.400
All she needs to do is recuperate.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.590
Alright.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.680
I heard it.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.800
Hurry.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.430
Here.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.040
Your Lordship,

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.660
you're being so sincere.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.310
Why are they still so wary of you?

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.790
I saw Ms. Chu hiding

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.720
behind the window.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.160
That simply means

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.750
she doesn't trust me enough yet.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.280
And...

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.920
To maintain her cover,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.240
you should call her

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.080
"My Lady"

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.940
whenever you see her.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.790
I...

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.310
Hope you'll get well soon.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.550
There are characters on each one.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.510
Hope everything goes well.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.200
We'll go through everything together.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.720
Did he spend the whole night

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.920
carving all this?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.760
I think...

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.200
Work together very well.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.790
I think His Lordship

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.790
really wants

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:23.680
to work with you.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.960
Shall we

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.480
trust him this once?

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.900
(Make concerted effort)

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.280
Do you remember?

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.240
No way.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.790
This fan

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.920
is named "Always Fan".

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.070
It can kill the enemy

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.510
before he even notices it.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.560
What do you think?

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.560
Now, I'm giving it

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.560
to you.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.270
You'll carry it.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.240
Now, to business.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.280
In the past few days,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.520
I've investigated

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.720
the man behind Wei Tongfeng.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.750
Now, I'm giving this

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.920
to you

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.270
and the fan.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.480
Lu Qiba,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.920
don't deal with me the way

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.760
you pursue a woman.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.030
These things

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.070
can't erase

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.240
our grievances.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.720
Come on, Wei Yun.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.310
Do I have to

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.680
say that word?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.920
All right, then.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.320
I admit.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.830
In the past,

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.750
I didn't submit to you.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.310
I didn't know you

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680
or trust you, either.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.750
The point is...

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.000
I didn't want to ruin
Wei Jun's hard work.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.140
But now,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.780
I think no one but you

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.780
will really develop our bureau.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.340
Wei Yun.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.780
Your Lordship,

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.780
I am

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.180
sorry.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.980
(Details of Wei Tongfeng's Case)

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.420
Compared to an apology,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.340
I expect you to tell me

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.500
why you gave me a hard time.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.620
And I hope you will

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.020
always be honest with me.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.260
Don't worry.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.180
Every time

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.260
I promise something

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.500
or trust someone,

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.980
I'll keep my word.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.380
(Yao Yong may have bribed Wei Tongfeng.)

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.860
Wei Tongfeng

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.340
is a regular visitor at Fragrance House.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.500
I sacrificed too much

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.420
just to investigate him.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.780
Pretty,

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.340
you're wearing really nice makeup.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.020
You look more beautiful.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.900
Mr. Lu, how many

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.060
sweet words

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.340
do you actually have?

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.020
I'm interested

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.980
in Wei Tongfeng,

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.060
your regular customer.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.060
If you tell me

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.420
who he has been seeing lately,

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.020
you will

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.420
get the money

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.060
and I'll sweet-talk you differently

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.580
three hundred times.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.140
No wonder we haven't

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.220
seen you around lately.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.580
So, you're interested in something else.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.140
A few days ago,

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.260
he often took me to Spring Breeze House

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.660
to meet a man.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.460
The pretty lady told me

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.100
Wei Tongfeng

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.420
always took her to Spring Breeze House

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.060
to meet a man.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.780
So,

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.380
I stalked that man.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.780
I found out...

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.220
In the Baidi Valley battle,

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.260
Yao Yong was with the Crown Prince

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.420
and he almost died.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.260
When the latter is suspicious,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.700
Yao Yong can't be clean.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.020
We can't let go

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.140
of the slightest suspicion.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.420
We must pursue it.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.620
Thank you.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.220
You're a great help.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.460
You really are Jun's brother.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.340
When he took over this job,

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:06.940
he also patted me like that.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.940
Your Lordship,

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.740
everybody is waiting.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.380
(Marshel)

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.380
(Loyalty)

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.580
(Justice)

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.140
I'm Lu Qiba, deputy commander
of the 1st Division

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.620
and the whole bureau.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.540
I'm Zhao Anjun, from the 2nd Division

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.380
of the Bureau.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.500
I'm Wei Shuo, from the 3rd Division

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.460
of the Bureau.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.580
I'm Gao Yi, from the 5th Division.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.180
All the divisions are here.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.020
We're yours to command.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.780
Greetings, Your Lordship.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.740
We're yours to command.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.260
I'd like to ask you all.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.220
What is the Arsenal Bureau?

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.980
The Arsenal Bureau

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.580
is the weapon of Great Sui.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.580
It guards the nation

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.780
and protects its people.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.460
I want you to remember.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.140
We protect our nation and its people.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.860
We defend this world.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.940
If anyone dares

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.940
to invade our nation,

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.060
this is how they'll end up.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.260
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.940
We'll always remember that.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.500
Where is the banner?

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.220
Here it is.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.940
(Wei)

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.380
(Wei)

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.180
(Wei)

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.500
Raise it.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.420
(Wei)

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.060
(Wei)

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.780
(Wei)

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.540
(Wei)

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.500
(Chu Mansion)

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.500
Your pulse is stable.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.860
But...

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.420
Inside it

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.700
are silver acupuncture needles.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.180
I've used them for five years.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.100
I value them more than my own life.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.500
Miss Song,

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.780
why did you do that?

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.220
Great.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.820
General Chu,

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.140
I was worried

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.500
that your condition had worsened.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.820
But I saw you catch it

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.220
really fast.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.140
No big health problems.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.020
You just need to improve

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.860
blocked meridians.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.340
Miss Song, may I ask

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.900
who taught you?

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.990
How long have you been learning?

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.940
General Chu,

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.500
hope I won't scare you.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.580
Actually,

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.340
I learned all this by myself.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.620
But don't worry.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.220
It's been five years.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.940
I often feign illness and learn

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.060
from imperial physicians in the palace.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.940
I've also saved many people in secret.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.460
Did you get those scars

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.420
when you practiced

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:12.980
on yourself?

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.100
They look ugly.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.940
But they're the proof

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.380
of how I've come this far.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.700
Come on.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.220
Look.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.340
I also got these scars

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.980
from the battles

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.980
against the North Qi army.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.460
I don't think they're ugly.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.060
Instead,

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.620
without them,

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.620
I wouldn't be what I am now.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.780
If in the future,

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.140
you still need arms

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.420
for acupuncture practice,

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.820
you can use mine.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.620
- I...
- My skin is tough.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:03.940
I'm not scared.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.900
Maybe different arms

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.380
will help you improve.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.860
What if

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.380
I hurt your arms?

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.380
I have faith in your medical skills.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.300
So,

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.020
have faith in yourself.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.540
Umm...

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.180
I'll teach you how to massage

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.620
for massive vital energy

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.620
and unblocked meridians.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.060
When you have free time,

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.900
you can press and lift like this.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.020
As for the timing...

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.780
You can count like this:

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.580
Tuantuan, press.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.940
Linyang, lift.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.540
Tuantuan, press.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.100
Linyang, lift.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:16.740
