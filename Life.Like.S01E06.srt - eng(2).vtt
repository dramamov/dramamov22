- Did you find it?
- Did you find it?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.760
When I arrived,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.400
Mr. Song was already dead.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.440
What's this?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.400
Something I found at Mr. Song's house.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.480
Red Bean?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.400
At the Song Residence,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.920
I saw a silhouette that looked a lot
like Rose from Night Shanghai.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.840
I suspect

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.560
Rose is actually Red Bean.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.480
If

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.200
Rose really is Red Bean,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.320
then she might know
where the students are.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.280
I've tested her,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.640
but found no flaw.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.800
So that means,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.080
Red Bean is quite a heroine.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.040
She only kills those who deserve to die.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.240
If I could meet her,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.900
that'd be a blessing of three lifetimes.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960
If she joined our cause,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.000
we'd be unstoppable, right?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.760
Wouldn't we?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.000
You wish.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.480
Hey,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.960
if Rose really is Red Bean,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.880
then when necessary,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.240
you could use
those special methods of yours

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.400
to test her.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.760
Yeah,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.320
try her out.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.240
Get lost, both of you!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.360
What's this?

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.040
Something I found at Mr. Song's house.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.600
It's all just names

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.640
and a key.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080
Keep it for now.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.240
Might come in handy later.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.360
Hey,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.560
got a light?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.720
Any progress today?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.760
Progress?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.000
Nothing found.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
This place

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.560
is like a ghost town every day.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.640
Then why are you still standing here?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.120
Hey!

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.240
Musheng,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.000
what a coincidence!

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.120
I was just passing by your place.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.840
I'll leave you be.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.600
I'll go now.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.200
Go on!

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.000
Silly.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.080
Boss,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.600
the spies we planted
near Zhou Musheng's house

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
have all been exposed.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.640
A bunch of fools!

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.760
Can't even handle something so simple!

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.760
Send a few sharper ones next time.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.080
Yes, Boss.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.760
I'll arrange it right away.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.040
Yao.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.600
Sir.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.440
Musheng,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.400
how's your recovery going?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.320
Thanks for asking, sir.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.320
I'm almost fully recovered.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.680
Don't call me sir,
it sounds too distant.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.960
Just call me Yue.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.040
I wouldn't dare.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.160
You risked your life

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.520
and took a bullet for me.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.560
From now on,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.480
you're my brother.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.520
Then,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.640
I'll take you at your word.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.960
Yue.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.720
Oh wow,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.000
Miss Man Li seems cheerful today.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920
The flowers smell nice.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.600
Keep your nose away from me.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.720
Who are they for?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.040
Of course

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.240
it's for Zhou Musheng.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.640
That's not appropriate.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.280
What do you mean?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.360
Let me explain it to you.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.320
You like Zhou Musheng,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.360
and you're giving him roses.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.680
Think about him and Rose,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.280
so you chose the wrong flower.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.520
Then,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.960
what should I give?

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.560
Chrysanthemums.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.000
They fit perfectly.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.320
Nothing nice ever comes from you.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.120
Good luck.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.000
I heard

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.480
Mr. Song was killed.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.920
I heard that.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.320
He smuggled weapons
and medicine for the Japanese.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.560
Must have been very rich.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.040
A real traitor.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.480
But now he's dead.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.160
No use keeping those treasures

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.560
at his house.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.440
I get it.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.240
I'll go talk to his family.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.000
Talk how?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.280
Make them understand what's best.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.320
They'll get the point.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.400
I told Luo Zhenyao

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.840
to handle this.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.240
But I don't trust him.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.800
You go instead.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.120
Remember,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.840
keep it quiet.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.520
Don't worry.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.680
Even ghosts won't know.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.160
It's not ghosts I fear.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.600
It's people

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.040
worse than ghosts.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.800
Musheng.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.760
For you.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.240
Hope you recover soon.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.440
I'm fine already.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.600
Thanks.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.920
Man Li.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.920
You're getting more and more unruly.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.960
Yue.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.480
Don't tell me you're mad at this?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.360
Yue,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.480
I want

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.960
to have dinner with Zhou Musheng.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.720
Is that okay?

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.120
You really leave me no choice.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.440
Be back early.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.880
Okay.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640
Hello, both of you.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.560
Right this way.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.240
This way, please.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.960
What would you like to order?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.120
Two sirloin steaks.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.520
One bottle of red wine.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:31.960
Thanks.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.800
Sure.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.320
Drinking at noon?

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.160
Won't Yue mind?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.160
It's fine. He's used to it.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.480
He treats you quite well.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.480
I help him a lot.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.680
So for little things,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.160
he turns a blind eye.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.080
Both eyes, sometimes.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.240
Man Li. I've got something to do.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.240
Can't stay for lunch.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.690
Next time.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.320
Promise.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:05.640
Hey.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.560
Senior.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.240
Musheng.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.600
Come.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.590
I'll show you something.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.760
(The moment he sees
that little fox, Rose,)

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.120
(he loses his soul.)

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:31.700
(Song Residence)

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.720
Why did you bring me here?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.200
You'll see soon.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.480
