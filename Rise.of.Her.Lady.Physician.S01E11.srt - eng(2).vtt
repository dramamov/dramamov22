00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.200
Attendant Feng!

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.800
Why are you here?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.480
I'm here for Purple-Snow Dew.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.480
We need to save Rong Zelan.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.920
How is she?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.960
The wound is infected,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.560
and she's dying.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.880
Wait a moment.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.600
Purple-Snow Dew is very precious.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.240
This is all we have left.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.160
You must be careful

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.840
and give it to her in person.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.680
It's all spilled.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.280
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.480
I didn't mean to.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.600
I was careless on the way.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.080
All the medicine
was knocked over and spilled.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.360
Idiot!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.720
Rong Zelan!

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.640
Can we find it elsewhere?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.040
No.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.640
The medicine is so precious

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.280
that the entire bureau

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.480
has only one bottle left.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.240
There's nothing that I,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.400
Song Lingxiao, cannot find.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.480
I'll look for it right away.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.000
Elder Zhong,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.000
I found it.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.280
It really is Purple-Snow Dew.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.000
Quickly, let her take it.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.040
Rong Zelan.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.280
The medicine is here.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.120
Take it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.800
I can't take it.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680
I need to test my master's medicine.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.720
Is it more important

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.680
than your life?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.000
There is no illness
that cannot be cured,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.360
as long as we never give up.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.560
I'm willing to use my life

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.920
to lend my master a helping hand.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.280
Silly kid.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.640
Don't force me.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.440
I'd rather die than take the medicine.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.160
Okay.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.520
I'll listen to you.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.520
But you promised

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.920
you wouldn't die here.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.760
You must keep your word.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.080
Girl!

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.960
Girl!

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.760
Girl!

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.720
Weren't you going to
learn medicine from me?

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.600
How could you leave me alone?

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.280
It's all my fault!

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.400
Elder Zhong,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.720
everyone has their destiny.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.360
Please don't be so sad.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.480
Girl!

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.920
You left in such a hurry that you

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.000
(Tablet of Rong Zelan)
didn't even get to wear new clothes!

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400
Keep

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.480
the paper money.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.840
Just buy

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.680
whatever you want down there.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.320
Wonderful.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.920
- You did well.
- Girl!

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.200
It's all thanks to

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.520
your brilliant strategy.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.040
About the transfer order...

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.100
- Shut up.
- You're so miserable!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.240
We'll submit it tomorrow.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.180
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.640
Uncle,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.560
Zhou Wenxi spilled the Purple-Snow Dew.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200
Rong Zelan had no cure

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.560
and died.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.680
Well done.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.960
It was a brilliant move

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.200
to tell you to win over

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.640
Attendant Zhou.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.460
As for the position of
second-class medical attendant,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.120
I've made all the arrangements.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.440
But don't forget

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.560
those old foxes in the bureau

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.600
are not easy to fool.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.680
You must show them
what you're capable of

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.680
so that they won't doubt you,

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.990
understand?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.860
Yes.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.720
Don't worry, uncle.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.880
I'm confident about this.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.080
No one can take this spot away.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.320
Being a second-class attendant
is not enough.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.960
I've made a plan for the position

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.000
of first-class attendant.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.920
I'll certainly become

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.080
a first-class attendant in half a year.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.080
Good.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.940
(Ji'an Office)

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.440
Elder Zhong.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.680
I...

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.800
Today, I'll go back to
the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.600
Get lost!

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.080
I don't want to see you again!

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.380
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.270
Yin,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.720
congratulations on your promotion.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.560
Congratulations!

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.620
From now on,
we'll all be counting on you.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.480
Wearing the second-class
attendant uniform,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.720
you look even more stunning.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.440
You'll become a first-class
attendant sooner or later.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.920
Thanks.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.600
This is...

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.960
What important occasion is it
at the Imperial Medical Bureau?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480
It's so lively.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.170
Who are you?

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.570
Where is the beggar from?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.600
Isn't this the lame old man
from the Ji'an Office?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.640
From the Ji'an Office?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.080
Why did someone from the morgue

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.520
come to the Imperial Medical Bureau?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.040
What a jinx.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.440
The bureau truly declines
with each generation.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.080
Little kid,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.320
mind your language.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.480
Old man,

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.880
it's Attendant Feng's big day.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.320
You must leave.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.740
Don't spoil our fun.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.200
Big day?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.490
That's exactly why

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.500
I came to join in the fun.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.280
- What's all the fuss about?
- You...

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.080
Since Attendant Feng Yin

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.520
came to the Imperial Medical Bureau,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.880
she has worked diligently

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.480
with exquisite skills,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.210
earning great merits.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.350
She is now promoted to
second-class attendant.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.840
She shall fulfill her duties and live up

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.040
to our expectations.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.840
Feng Yin,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.160
accept the waist token

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.760
and the appointment letter.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.340
(Letter of Appointment)

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.260
Wait a moment.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.440
How dare you, an old man from

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.280
the Ji'an Office, trespass into
the Imperial Medical Bureau?

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.280
Guards, throw him out!

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.400
Where is Wu Chunlin?

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.220
- Bring him to me!
- Just leave!

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.960
- Just go!
- Go!

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.280
Where is Wu Chunlin?

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.440
Who do you think you are?

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:36.560
How dare you call

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.910
Minister Wu by his full name?

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.880
You must leave right now!

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.400
- Get lost!
- Leave!

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.120
- Leave!
- Stop!

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.440
Lord Wu.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.400
Everyone, step back!

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.880
Elder Zhong,
I didn't know you were coming.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.000
Sorry for

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.960
the inhospitality!

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.840
This...

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.360
Who just

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.350
spouted nonsense

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.630
and insulted Elder Zhong?

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.640
Do you know who he is?

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.280
Elder Zhong was

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.120
the military doctor who followed the late
emperor through countless battles

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.680
and helped establish the nation.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.120
He saved the late emperor's life
multiple times.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.960
After the founding

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.200
of the nation,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.480
Elder Zhong established
the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.080
He is the first minister

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.320
of the Imperial Medical Bureau

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.560
as well as my uncle-master.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.200
Turns out he's the grandmaster!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.640
- Elder Zhong.
- Grandmaster!

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.080
Elder Zhong

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.080
is a man

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.840
of great virtue and prestige.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.480
These little rascals

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.800
insisted on

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.560
kicking me out.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.520
It seems your heads

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.960
are too heavy

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.040
to carry

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.920
and need a break,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.360
right?

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.880
- We wouldn't dare!
- No!

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.760
We wouldn't dare!

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.080
We're fighting our own!
What a misunderstanding!

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.000
Elder Zhong,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.960
I didn't recognize you.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.120
Sorry for the offense.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.700
Please forgive me.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.860
I believe you're kind and generous

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.560
and won't take it seriously.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.240
Elder Zhong,
you've been living in seclusion

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.200
for many years.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.600
What brings you here today?

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.480
Today, I came here

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.400
to bring you

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.720
a second-class medical attendant.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.240
Second-class medical attendant?

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.280
Who is it?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.160
Girl.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.040
Come in

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.920
and meet everyone.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.760
How could it be her?

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.000
Why is she still alive?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.920
Rong Zelan?

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.620
How did she come back to life?

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.680
Feng Yin,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.680
what do you think?
