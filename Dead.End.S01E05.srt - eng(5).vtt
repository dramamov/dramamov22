[Episode 5]

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.740
[2012]

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.400
Don't tell me

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.460
you're planning to jump in the river.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.760
I thought

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.590
you wouldn't come here anymore.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.150
I came before.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.389
Seeing that you kept coming,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.060
I decided to stay away.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.720
Then why did you come today?

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.520
Tell me about it.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400
Tell me about that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.610
hutong killer.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.470
No progress.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.930
The surveillance footage is unclear.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.190
The victim is now

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.300
unreachable, too.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.470
Unreachable?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.680
When that girl filed the report,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.280
she gave a fake workplace.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.800
The phone could be reached at first,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.660
but now it can't be reached at all.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.030
Then that girl's not exactly legit.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.660
What about other surveillance footage?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.120
We're still looking.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.050
There aren't many cameras nearby.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.310
Stop looking for the suspect.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.000
Look for the girl

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.120
who filed the report in the footage.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.910
See where

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.310
she went from and to.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.800
Maybe the itinerary she described

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.030
was completely fake.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.120
That girl who filed the report
should be easy to find.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:20.560
Mentor.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.100
The bureau is this way.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.910
Isn't your home

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.710
over there?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.079
How did you know?

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.560

Hello?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.579
Are you doing well?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.220
I'm doing fine.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.360
How are you?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.100
I'm doing well.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.080
Well then,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.560
don't waste phone credit
if nothing's wrong.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.700
I'm hanging up.

This way.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.630
Back then,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.900
you turned down
the community housing allocation.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.040
Where did you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.880
spend all your money?

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.950
Was that your wife on the phone just now?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.400
Is she still in the South?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.190
Every year around this time,

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.800
she gets some allergies

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.730
and goes to stay somewhere else
for a few months.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.760
These are all materials

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.510
and evidence I collected in my spare time.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.130
I arranged them again.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.000
I don't know if they'll be useful.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.330
There's more over here.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.060
These are all

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.180
Fuyilian brand thermal containers.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.950
They're the same as the ones used
by our branch's forensics department.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.950
Over 60,000 each.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.800
Are you

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.270

It's been a while.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.160
Please, sit down.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.870
Sit down.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.120
Not bad.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.180
You're in great shape.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.610
You have good taste.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.000
That's why

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600
you are the boss.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.090
Here is the thing, Ran.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.310
About this case,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.510
Zhao is convinced

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.860
it's connected to that one back then.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.860
So,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.720
I'd like to hear your opinion.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720
What do you think?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.680
It might be.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.120
Or it might not.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.820
Don't say "might."

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.870
That case from back then

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.730
has been weighing on my mind, too.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.800
Look at the young police officers,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.400
coming in one after another.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.360
We can't leave our unfinished business

from back then to them,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.920
right?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.730
Don't worry.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.800
My mentor and I

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.480
can solve it.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.240
Fine.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.160
Then this case

is assigned to you two.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.390
You both worked on it back then,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.720
so you know the details.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.290

the Criminal Police Team to help us.

Well.

all my ailments disappear.

I might even live a few more years.

Alright.

What's this about?

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.870
It's about Liu Ke's case from back then.

We're reopening the investigation now.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.370
We're here to ask

-It's…
-18 years.
