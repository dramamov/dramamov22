00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.380
(Xu Residence)

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.750
How beautiful.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.280
Wanning,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.390
after you become the consort,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.390
don't forget

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.710
your younger siblings.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.880
Isn't that right, Wanzhen?

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.470
You're reaching marrying age.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.920
As her sister, find her a fine young noble

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
among the royal clans.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.320
And your younger brother.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.480
Remember to help his career.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.560
Mother, why won't you let me go with you?

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.870
Chang'an, I have no choice.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.480
Trust me.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.710
Once it's settled,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.510
I'll come back to get you.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.310
Be good and wait for me, all right?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.640
- Mm.
- All right.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.790
Get in the sedan chair.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.040
Or we'll be late.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.510
Help her up! Hurry!

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.240
Mother.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.350
Chang'an, stop making trouble.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.870
Your mother is going to enjoy a good life.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.040
You should stay here.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.350
Don't be a burden to her.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.550
Come on.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.100
Raise the sedan chair

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.100
(Happiness)

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.460
(Xu Residence)

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.860
(Prince's Mansion)

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.070
All set?

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.680
Princess, as you ordered.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.120
The poison is in the tea.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.360
One sip

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.190
and her intestines will rot.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.100
(Happiness)

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.300
(Prince's Mansion)

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.150
Sorry for the simple arrangement.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.360
It's really a bit humble.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.960
I don't mind these things.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.030
We're getting married.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.750
Maybe it's time you stopped being so formal.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.670
Commander?

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.960
Do you really want to marry him?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.610
I...

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.400
If you do,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.080
you wouldn't hesitate.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.400
Pei Heng!

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.910
I show you respect for your service

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.430
to the Emperor,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.120
yet you show no manners at all.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.430
How dare you
snatch my woman at my wedding?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.800
You've been kneeling for a day and a night.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.000
Do you love her that much?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.560
I ask for nothing else.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.800
Only Xu Wanning.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.150
I understand what troubles Your Majesty.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.710
I will certainly do my utmost

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.430
to find evidence of the Prince's crimes

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.120
and eliminate the hidden threat.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.470
If I fail,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.310
take my life.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.470
You'd stake your life
for a divorced woman

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.910
with a child? Is it worth it?

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.480
To others, she is just a divorcée.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.750
But to me,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.750
she is extremely precious.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.360
Even if I am shattered to pieces,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.310
I will still protect her.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.190
I have the Emperor's decree of marriage.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.630
To defy it is death on the spot.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.600
Don't hide behind authority to threaten me.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.910
Hyah!

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.230
Get them!

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.680
- Mother.
- Aunt Ning.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.920
Chang'an, why are you here?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.870
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.560
So I came find Master.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.600
Didn't I tell you

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.240
I'd come back for you?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.630
Mother, are you married to Master now?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.040
Can I call him Father?

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.800
It's a little complicated.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.800
I'll explain it to you later, okay?

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.510
Aunt Ning, I'll go check on Master.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.110
All right.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.360
Mm.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.360
Be careful.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.230
Mm.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.870
Mother, I want to sleep with you tonight.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.830
Don't leave me again.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.080
Okay.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.720
Let's eat something first.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.870
Then go to sleep, all right?

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.760
Mm.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.640
Okay.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.150
Master.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.350
What is it?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.270
Master, today is your wedding day.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.950
I'd like to toast you.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.240
Children shouldn't drink alcohol.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.000
To celebrate. Just one shot.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.960
(Celebrate...)

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.160
(Will she be happy?)

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.830
You drank it all?

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.630
Master, I'm so sleepy.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.560
I want to sleep with Aunt Ning.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.190
I want to sleep with Aunt Ning.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.000
So easily tipsy, huh?

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.000
Your acting is a bit too fake.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.150
Master, stay with me for a while.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.150
Just for a little while.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.120
A little while.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.840
Mm.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.240
Go to sleep now.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.840
