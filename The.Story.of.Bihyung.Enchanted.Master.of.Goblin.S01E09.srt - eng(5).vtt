I can't help but be curious,

Are you really sick?

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.230
You were there on the mountain,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.560
and you were at my house, too.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.890
Hey. You've come to the wrong place.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.270
I've confirmed it—our relationship.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.010
Hey, you being like this, Keumbok will—

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.470
no—does Bihyung know?

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.250
This is my privacy.

You're so pretty
I can't even bear to look at you.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.440
You made me fall for you,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.610

did you do all this?

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.040
The more he gets entangled

So... he appeared after I died?

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.430
You're too naive!

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.090
I'm surprised you're still alive
in a goblin's house.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.400
Goblin?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.570
No way.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.800
You can see ghosts.
Why don't you believe in goblins?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.650
Falling from such a high place,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.270
how could a human still be alive?

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.160
Otherwise, it wouldn't be me
in front of you, but the Grim Reaper.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.440
I have to catch this darn snake—

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.600
Oh, right. This guy is also a goblin.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.580
How could he be a human with that body?

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.520
Can Bihyung...

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.270
wake up?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.680
He expended too much of his energy.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.000
If this state continues,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.659
he might never wake up.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.760
Without essence, I don't think
he can make it through the 16th.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.380
Essence.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.910
I can give him essence!
If he sucks essence from me—

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.840
Even so, he can't wake up.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.920
Without his master's summon.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.640
We can just go find this master.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.940
Where is he?

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.720
We can't find him.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.520
He left Bihyung 1,000 years ago.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.160
1,000 years?

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.630
That's why, Ha Keumbok,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.409
we need you.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:35.280
What?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.710
Travel back to the past
and stop Bihyung from meeting his master.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.789
Then he'll wake up on his own eventually.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.300
In other words,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.460
we just need to make sure
he doesn't meet his owner?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.570
Halmeoni!

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.350
Let me do it.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.250
Cheoyong is only allowing
Ha Keumbok to do it.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.150
How can we trust him?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.830
He was the one who made Bihyung like this
to begin with—

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:05.000
He wants Bihyung to be alone.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:11.180
That's why he did that to Keumbok, too.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.920
You may not believe it,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.640
but he really wants Bihyung to come back.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.290
I'll do it.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.520
Keumbok!

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.590
I feel like my brain is going to explode.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.310
But one thing is for sure,

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.960
he won't wake up if I don't go.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.590
So...

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.130
I'll go.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.710
I'll go and save him.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.770
I heard that a full moon eclipse happened

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.210
when he met his master.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.030
Just hang in...

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.380
Just hang in there until then.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.310
Ha Keumbok.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.510
You'll forget everything

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.120

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.620

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.500

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.640
After three days...

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.310
The 16th?

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.790
You're going to make someone forget
a person they care about the most.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.890
You should be prepared to lose something.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.140
Can you do it?

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.450
How did you find me?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.190
Who sent you?

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.350

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.770
Or is it that stinky fox again?

What's going on?

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.430
I can't make a sound.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.880
I thought this was just
an abandoned house.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.910

just say it.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.350
How can I just say it
when you're threatening me with a knife?

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.090

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.500
By the way,

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.850
Did it get eaten by a dog?

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.680
Or are you a slave who fled?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.350
Was it cut by your master?

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.930
You're neither a beggar nor a slave.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.570
Why would you
be living in a place like this?

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.100
Are you telling me to stop talking
and just eat?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.250
Forget it.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.930
Not only do I look noble,

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.410

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.470

for appreciating beauty.

Don't you want to know who I am?

Do you know about the goblin
with a kill order on him?

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.090
Apparently, the war,

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.930
drought, and plague over the past 10 years

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.860
were all caused by that goblin king.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.380
I thought I was just helping
by following the king's orders.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.800
In the end, it was all a lie.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:11.190
I'm here to kill the goblin king, Bihyung.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.020
Tell me if you see anyone suspicious.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.980
Don't be bewitched by the goblin.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.540
I'll be practicing over there.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.410
Don't follow me.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.060
I told you not to follow me.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.690
Hey.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.800
[Keum]

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.340
[Bok]

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.450
What are these characters?

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.120
Ah.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.940
You haven't learned how to read, have you?

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.180
Don't be ashamed.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.950
[Bihyung]

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.260
That's my name.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.780
Right.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:40.210
In your eyes, these words
probably look like they're dancing.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.630
This roar comes from
this Tiger Mountain's elder.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.330
He's warning those who have
evil intentions toward Tiger Mountain.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.670
The goblin king, who stirred up
a bloody storm, might be scared of it,

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.370
But there's no need for weak
and young people like you to worry.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.050
By the way,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.750
You're scared by such a small noise.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.070
I guess my embrace
feels reliable to you.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.720
Is he crazy?

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.830
At this time,

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.850
he laughed a lot.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.950
What about Jigwi?

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.310
As you guessed,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.310
he approached us to get the medicine.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.390
So, where is his brother?

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.420
I heard that a few days ago...

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.970
he died.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.110
Speaking of which, this house's owner
is unable to speak.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.520
That's fortunate.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.220
Fortunate?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.110
How could you say that?

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.020
Huh?

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.460
My apologies.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.040
The Killer Corps will be here soon.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.080
Now that everything is ready,
you just need to leave.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.460
What about him?

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.550
I'm afraid that being involved
with us will be his greatest suffering.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.810
We won't have anyone on our side anymore.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.310
We must depart immediately, Bihyung.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.880
Did he meet his master

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.630
and leave this place?

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.180
It can't be.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.590
They said he met his master here

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.230
during the full moon eclipse.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.540
It's been four days.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.470
But it felt like a thousand years.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.100
This roar comes from
this Tiger Mountain's elder.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.840
The goblin king, who stirred up
a bloody storm, might be scared of it,

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.740
But there's no need for weak
and young people like you to worry.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.040
He's still here.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.990
You absorbed some essence?

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.680
To be exact, after I touched him,

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.750
my recovery accelerated.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.860
Does that mean he's...

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.900
Yes.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.840
That's a relief.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.500
Then before the Killer Corps arrive,
get him...

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.690
The deeper he gets involved with me,

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.100
he may have it tougher than I do.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.590
But he's the only human
you can get essence from.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.390
You should take him with you,
even if you have to use brute force.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.790
You can't be swayed
by insignificant things

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.750
like empathy.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.120
This is not empathy.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.740
Until now,

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:00.310
I've never been so anxious and greedy.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.310
But Gildal...

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.870
I...

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.430
felt fear for the first time.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.610
How can this feeling

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.550
be just empathy?

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.020
I heard that
the full moon eclipse happened

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.490
when he picked his master.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.330
Just hang in...

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.950
Just hang in there until then.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.920
Master?

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.370
I'll come back later, then.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.290
Now that I'm fully recovered,

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.860
I have no reason to stay here.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.650
Are you telling me not to leave?

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.590
The bleeding stopped in just one night.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.290
It didn't even leave a scar.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:48.340
Do you think I'm a normal human being?

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.320
You don't know me.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.600
Don't stop me.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.830
Go back in

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.700
before I hurt you.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.450
I'm not from the Killer Corps.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.250
I'm that Bihyung.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.450
You knew?

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.190
That I was a goblin?

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.300
I was curious.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.700
Why did you help me,
someone you'd never met before?

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.170
Why do I feel at ease by your side?

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.500
But it doesn't matter now.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:28.790
You found me,
and I'm willing to give myself to you.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.660
This is the token
that proves I belong to you.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.120
From now on, you are my master.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.750
We have to hurry.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.520
I'll go get the candle. Just wait.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:20.360
The one he missed
for a thousand years...

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.170
was me.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.050
I was his master.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.810
How old-fashioned.
Who gives things like this anymore?
