00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:49.891
How did you escape?

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.490
Even sect leaders...

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.130
Do you remember

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.251
how Gu Qianfu
was trying to kill me before?

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:00.410
Am I that valuable?

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:02.050
Why chase me so relentlessly?

00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:07.171
20,000 liang?

00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:08.251
Impossible!

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:09.410
Must be 200,000 liang.

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:10.931
Two liang.

00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.130
Your turn.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.290
Wait!

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.251
Think I'm someone

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.450
who can be bribed

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.730
by one liang?

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.410
I offered two!

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.570
These two liang

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.290
double what you'd get

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.211
for this job.

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:34.771
How'd you know?

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.091
I don't.

00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:37.371
Just guessed.

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:39.531
Your throwing skills are divine,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.331
yet you're poor.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.410
Must be the lowest-ranked assassin.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.091
Assassin ranks go Class A to G.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.091
Class A takes 200 liang.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.971
Class B 100 liang.

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:53.491
C 50 liang.

00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:54.890
D 10 liang.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.850
E two liang.

00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:57.730
G one liang.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.251
A Class A assassin
took the job at 200 liang.

00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:01.610
But when

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:03.971
it gets to you...

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.211
So,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.931
they do nothing

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:11.890
yet earn

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:13.371
hundreds liang!

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.850
I work so hard

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.211
yet earn one liang daily!

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:18.651
Exactly!

00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:19.771
The middleman

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.690
exploits much.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.570
Spot on!

00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:24.771
Then why not

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.010
take my two liang?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.651
Take it

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.931
and pretend to kill me.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.690
Then

00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:32.170
grab midnight snack

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.971
and get off work.

00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.331
Perfect, right?

00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:51.331
(Money is not working?)

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.251
Go.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.051
Wait.

00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:07.690
Why?

00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:08.331
Knife.

00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.891
You're ruthless, bro.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.091
It's okay, you can go.

00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:25.850
I'll handle it.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.810
Farewell.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.011
Xue Hexu!

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.370
What?

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.011
Gu Qianfu lied?

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.850
He denied coming to kill you

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.410
under Grand Tutor's order?

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.451
Gu Qianfu is innocent.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.290
The order passed through many.

00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:07.490
And Gu Qianfu

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.771
didn't know
it is Grand Tutor Zhou's order.

00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:11.810
I wonder

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.610
why the Jing'an Bureau hired

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.211
assassins twice to kill me,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.610
instead of

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.451
using their men?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.691
Young Master's missing

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.050
likely connects to Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:25.370
Youshou's missing?

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.370
When?

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.850
Dawn today,

00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:30.331
when you departed.

00:05:31.011 --> 00:05:32.170
(According to Grand Tutor,)

00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:33.971
(Youshou isn't the Crown Prince.)

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.531
(What's his relationship
to Grand Tutor?)

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.891
(Who am I really?)

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.810
The Emperor saw Youshou's portrait.

00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:44.131
I'd never surrender him,

00:05:44.571 --> 00:05:45.730
nor let you take his place.

00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:50.170
Since I take his place,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.571
let's fake my death

00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:53.370
to end this hunt!

00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:56.850
Youshou has lived
as a shadow for decades

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.211
and suffered much.

00:05:58.771 --> 00:06:00.571
Time for someone else to take over.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.211
My survival

00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:06.091
must stay secret.

00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:07.730
It'd be dangerous

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.050
if others know it.

00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:13.451
Be careful

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:15.131
then.

00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:16.571
I know.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.930
For you,

00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:19.410
I'll survive.

00:06:23.531 --> 00:06:24.250
(Perfect timing)

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.250
(to uncover Grand Tutor's motives,)

00:06:27.571 --> 00:06:29.131
(find out where Xue Youshou is,)

00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:31.571
(and why he impersonates me.)

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.490
(Memorial)
Miss Feng has arrived.

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:16.451
I confirmed

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:17.930
the former Crown Prince

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.930
is the illegitimate son
in the south of Xue family,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:20.610
Xue Youshou.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.691
I've executed him.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.410
Jia Xun.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.771
This nation

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.850
belongs to me.

00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:18.971
Heavenly blessings descend!

00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:21.410
Your Majesty, you're the true emperor.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.891
Your boundless fortune

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.891
shall ensure Hua Dynasty's
everlasting prosperity.

00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:30.011
Long live His Majesty!

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.331
(This Immortal knows
how to pick his moment.)

00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:37.530
Rise.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.811
Feng Zuoren.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.130
You seem to have forgotten something.

00:08:56.051 --> 00:08:56.650
Your Majesty.

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:58.211
People of Xue family

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.530
were also pawns.

00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:02.451
It was all that rebel's scheme.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.850
It seems

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.331
you want to protect the Xue family.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.091
I wouldn't dare.

00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:11.331
I haven't fully verified

00:09:11.331 --> 00:09:12.730
Xue Youshou's true identity.

00:09:12.971 --> 00:09:13.250
So...

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.650
You failed to complete my mission.

00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:16.411
Guards! Take her away and

00:09:16.691 --> 00:09:17.211
execute her!

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.010
Your Majesty.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.931
Avoid bloodshed
within the palace recently.

00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:40.331
Wait!

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.211
Mr. Immortal,

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:50.890
you make sense.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.650
Thank you for your mercy.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.232
Your Majesty,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.171
I'll obtain a blessed talisman
from the temple

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.091
to ward off evil for you.

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:05.370
Thank you, Mr. Immortal.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.091
(Feng Shui array?)

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.370
(This man knows Daoist arts well.)

00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:13.730
Your worries have eased.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.211
Let me divine.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.610
(Western-style?)

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.571
(Blending Eastern and Western styles?)

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.691
Your Majesty,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.730
wear red garments

00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.370
or crimson cords recently.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.770
On an auspicious date,

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.730
go visit temples for worship

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:30.890
and pray for protection.

00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:31.971
(Indian?)

00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:33.490
(Japanese?)

00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:35.250
(Why various styles?)

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:36.520
Your Majesty,

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.530
the time has come.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.130
Right.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.691
Attendants!

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:51.890
Your Majesty,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.211
this is the Foot Bathing Cauldron,

00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:55.971
mandated by heaven,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.130
a divine artifact
protecting all living beings.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.411
Its interior

00:11:01.091 --> 00:11:03.091
contains mysterious energies.

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:05.730
Soak nightly for one hour

00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:07.890
to strengthen your body

00:11:08.411 --> 00:11:11.051
and absorb cosmic essence.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.850
(This is just a regular foot basin.)

00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:17.691
(Ten wen for three.)

00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:19.370
Heavenly Nectar Oil!

00:11:22.451 --> 00:11:24.610
It's extracted from heavenly dew.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.370
When added,

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.730
it improves circulation
and nourishes skin.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.811
(Ordinary rose oil,)

00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:34.370
(three wen per jug.)

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.610
(Enough for half a year.)

00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:38.571
This is the Nine-Cycle Golden Pill!

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.010
(Is it just brown sugar ball?)

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.370
Not yet.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.051
One final step required.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.211
Now!

00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:03.171
Mr. Immortal is really remarkable.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.171
Not only medicine and divination,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.250
but also masterful in Feng Shui.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.650
Thanks to him,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.051
Your Majesty's health
has improved greatly.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.411
Is that true?

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.370
Absolutely!

00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:17.864
Your Majesty,

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:20.250
just follow my methods,

00:12:21.051 --> 00:12:21.890
then you

00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:23.691
could rule over Hua

00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:26.211
for thousands of years.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.411
For thousands of years?

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.850
Can my body

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:38.770
truly last that long?

00:12:38.931 --> 00:12:39.451
Absolutely.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.171
Based on your birth chart

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.370
and current celestial observations,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.650
if you want to stay healthy,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.291
avoid bloodshed recently.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.171
Otherwise, it'll diminish your fortune.

00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:57.211
In that case,

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.811
I shall

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.490
temporarily spare Feng Zuoren

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.411
and the entire Xue family.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.250
Your Majesty,

00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:09.691
time to go to sleep.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.331
Align your head 45 degrees southwest,

00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:16.130
using the Heavenly Pillow I provided,

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.291
to optimally absorb the moon's essence,

00:13:20.691 --> 00:13:22.130
purify the toxins in your body,

00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:23.530
and get restful sleep.

00:13:26.331 --> 00:13:27.411
Thank you, Mr. Immortal.

00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:38.811
Stop!

00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:42.091
By schedule,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.451
Yuehe should be on duty tonight.

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:46.250
Where is she?

00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:49.091
Mr. Immortal said her zodiac
conflicts with His Majesty's,

00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:50.091
so she's reassigned.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.130
What's that in your hand?

00:13:54.411 --> 00:13:55.530
Let me tell you.

00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:57.130
This is Blessed Sleep Elixir.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.211
Just one sip

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.451
guarantees peaceful sleep.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.850
Eight liang per bottle.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.250
Silk tree bark,

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.411
spina date seeds,

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.451
poria root...

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:13.571
All common sedative herbs.

00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:15.370
(It surely brings peaceful sleep.)

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.650
(But eight liang?)

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.451
(A string of coins buys a vat-full.)

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.291
Mr. Immortal is skilled in medicine

00:14:22.411 --> 00:14:23.730
and divination.

00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:24.770
He once predicted

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.610
I'd gain wealth
on this month's eighth day,

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.530
and it came true!

00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:29.971
We get paid every eighth day.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.571
Common knowledge.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.890
He's just a fraud.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.411
Thank you for saving my life.

00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:47.530
Your mighty powers earn imperial favor.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.931
Might I request a divination?

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.291
What concerns you?

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.730
As Western divinations,

00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:02.650
different birthdates align
with twelve zodiac houses.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.571
Born on the first of the twelfth month,

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:05.971
what's my zodiac house

00:15:06.331 --> 00:15:07.730
and my fortune this month?

00:15:13.811 --> 00:15:14.850
Well,

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.610
by Western divinations,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.010
your zodiac house

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.770
is Scorpio.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.650
Scorpio's fortune this month...

00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:24.971
With good luck,

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:26.650
disasters become blessings.

00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:28.291
But with ill luck,

00:15:29.171 --> 00:15:30.931
bloodshed awaits.

00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:32.130
(Nonsense!)

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.770
(My zodiac house)

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.091
(isn't Scorpio at all,)

00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:36.250
(but Sagittarius.)

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.691
(He knows nothing.)

00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:40.130
Then,

00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:42.571
I've been gaining weight

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:43.451
lately.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.850
Any solution?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.211
Your figure is admirable,

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.490
yet you're so strict with yourself.

00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:55.291
Everyone wants

00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:56.730
to be perfect.

00:15:57.211 --> 00:15:58.091
You've

00:15:58.091 --> 00:15:59.250
asked the right person.

00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:03.291
Just follow my dietary plan

00:16:03.451 --> 00:16:04.331
and exercise schedule.

00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:06.250
Most crucially,

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.490
have my Fitness Elixir.

00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:12.091
(Weight-loss Tea)
In a month,

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.770
you'll slim down.

00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:19.171
88 liang.

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:19.931
Per bottle?

00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:22.530
For three days.

00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:24.250
Three days per treatment,

00:16:24.691 --> 00:16:26.051
minimum ten treatments.

00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:27.250
(Eat)

00:16:27.451 --> 00:16:28.770
(half-bowl rice per meal.)

00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:29.832
(No food after noon.)

00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:31.250
(Four-hour daily exercise.)

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.411
(Dieting and exercising.)

00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:34.811
(Why do I need his elixir?)

00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:37.530
I have no money. Maybe next time.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:38.250
Wait.

00:16:39.971 --> 00:16:41.890
It seems you don't trust me.

00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:44.571
Then I'll divine
another fortune for you.

00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:57.530
The person you seek

00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:00.010
is just

00:17:00.691 --> 00:17:02.370
in front of you.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.010
Young Master?

00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:17.371
You seemed so tense,

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:18.931
so I teased you.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.010
I've been searching for you.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.330
Never imagined you'd enter the palace.

00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:24.730
But

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.611
why are you Mr. Immortal?

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.211
Long story.

00:17:28.211 --> 00:17:29.131
Guards!

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.570
Coming!

00:17:43.411 --> 00:17:43.851
This...

00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:44.330
Yueji.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:45.770
Coming.

00:18:03.891 --> 00:18:05.371
During my wanderings,

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.810
I met a Taoist priest,

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.931
an eminent scholar
from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:11.851
Been through a lot,

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.451
he brought me back here.

00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:16.330
Fate plays its tricks.

00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:17.931
To survive,

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.691
I have to stay
in the most perilous place.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.131
But you've been here for so long,

00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:27.691
why not tell me about it?

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.651
First,

00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:30.770
it is risky.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.330
Second,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.371
in the palace,

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.971
every word and action

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.290
is monitored by the Emperor.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.651
I wanted to tell you privately,

00:18:41.931 --> 00:18:42.530
but

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.891
I couldn't guarantee

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.330
escaping the Emperor's surveillance.

00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:49.691
Moreover,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.611
once I told you who I am,

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.330
you'd act rashly,

00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:56.770
exposing yourself to danger.

00:18:57.891 --> 00:18:58.931
My silence

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.971
protects you.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.730
You left without word,

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:06.770
I thought you'd been killed.

00:19:08.411 --> 00:19:10.691
That day the Emperor
suddenly summoned me,

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.211
I had to leave urgently

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:13.891
without farewells.

00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:15.891
Right.

00:19:16.371 --> 00:19:17.810
We need a thorough plan.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:20.010
Tell me,

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.250
where is Xue Hexu?

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:23.851
He

00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:26.211
died by Grand Tutor Zhou's men.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.451
I made him killed.

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:34.411
What matters now

00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:36.530
is to protect the Xue family.

00:19:39.851 --> 00:19:40.570
Rest assured.

00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:43.810
Lord Dingyuan saved my life once.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.891
I'll surely find a way
to protect his family.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.931
I need an imperial edict

00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:51.810
to legitimately

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.691
meet with Lord Dingyuan.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.611
(Taiji Hall)

00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:01.256
Your Majesty,

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.611
this cushion comes from jade carved

00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:06.611
from the ice bed once used

00:20:06.691 --> 00:20:09.250
by the Condor Heroes couple.

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:12.730
Regular use prolongs life

00:20:13.451 --> 00:20:15.050
and stays healthy.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:26.530
Why

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.971
did it shatter?

00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:36.451
You could break even
such an unbreakable item

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.411
with mere sitting,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.891
proving you are so mighty

00:20:41.651 --> 00:20:43.570
that nothing can stop you

00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:45.171
in the war

00:20:45.651 --> 00:20:47.171
from now on.

00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:50.770
Long live Your Majesty!

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:54.891
Your Majesty,

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.290
this Life-extending Elixir

00:20:57.651 --> 00:20:59.810
is purified for seven days,

00:21:00.411 --> 00:21:02.810
can cleanse your impurities.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.050
Why sand inside?

00:21:16.891 --> 00:21:21.171
These are Essence Crystals formed
during purification.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.490
A once-in-a-century marvel!

00:21:23.971 --> 00:21:24.651
This signifies

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.530
heaven itself blesses you.

00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:35.770
Your Majesty,

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.290
last night I made a divination

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:40.851
and discovered

00:21:41.131 --> 00:21:43.211
why you fell ill.

00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:46.330
Tell me.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.050
You need
to lift the burden in your mind.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.371
(What has he been through)

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.211
(to become what he is now?)

00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:55.090
You mean,

00:21:55.971 --> 00:21:57.371
the burden in my mind

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.411
caused my sickness?

00:21:59.971 --> 00:22:00.611
Exactly.

00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:03.931
I deduced from the divination

00:22:04.611 --> 00:22:05.770
that the burden in your mind

00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:07.810
lies southeast,

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.851
the mansion in the third street.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.451
It's the Xue Mansion.

00:22:17.915 --> 00:22:20.412
(Xue Family Ancestral Hall)

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.211
Hexu.

00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:27.971
You promised to watch me grow up

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.330
and get married.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.730
Why would you...

00:22:34.171 --> 00:22:35.611
You're so young.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.971
How could you leave your father

00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:41.651
alone?

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:44.810
Hexu.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.530
You must be hiding somewhere,

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.010
playing tricks on me.

00:22:48.651 --> 00:22:49.330
Come out now!

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.131
I'll get angry if you don't show up!

00:22:51.211 --> 00:22:51.611
Dongyang.

00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:52.330
- Dongyang!
- Come out! - Dongyang.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:53.971
You're just playing with me, right?

00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:54.931
Come out now!

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.050
- Dongyang!
- I'll get angry!

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.611
- I'm getting angry!
- Dongyang!

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.891
Dongyang!

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.371
Show yourself.

00:23:01.891 --> 00:23:03.010
- Hexu.
- Stop this!

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.891
Enough!

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.971
Dongyang!

00:23:06.171 --> 00:23:06.851
Come out now!

00:23:06.891 --> 00:23:07.691
- Stop hiding!
- Dongyang!

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.250
- I'm getting angry!
- Dongyang!

00:23:09.411 --> 00:23:09.851
Calm down.

00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:10.611
Come out now!

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:11.530
I'm getting angry.

00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:12.810
- I'm getting angry!
- Dongyang!

00:23:16.171 --> 00:23:16.851
Hexu!

00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:18.891
Hexu!

00:23:20.971 --> 00:23:21.411
Dongyang!

00:23:21.411 --> 00:23:22.050
Dongyang.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.171
You're consumed by grief.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.451
He's right there.

00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.570
- His spirit appears!
- Dongyang!

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.090
I understand your pain,

00:23:31.851 --> 00:23:33.530
but you must face reality.

00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:35.411
Hexu is dead.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:36.651
No, Grandmother.

00:23:36.891 --> 00:23:37.851
He's truly there.

00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:39.530
(Forgive me,)

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.680
(Dongyang.)

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.250
Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:23:43.851 --> 00:23:46.250
I'll make you pay with blood!

00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:49.131
Lord Dingyuan, come
to receive the imperial decree.

00:23:59.651 --> 00:24:02.330
By Heaven's Mandate,
the Emperor decrees:

00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:05.330
Recent disturbances
plague the Lord Dingyuan's Mansion.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.371
There might be evil forces haunting.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.250
Mr. Immortal from the Imperial Astronomical
Bureau comes to eradicate them.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.810
That's it.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.290
We thank Your Majesty's grace.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.451
Mr. Immortal.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:33.090
Your Majesty.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.211
The former Crown Prince's threat

00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:36.651
no longer exists.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.730
Are you sure?

00:24:39.971 --> 00:24:41.211
The one I do not want to see

00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:43.570
has gone?

00:24:44.891 --> 00:24:46.490
Exactly.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:48.330
However,

00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:51.451
there are evil forces
haunting in the Xue family,

00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:55.090
threatening your fortune.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.851
I'll go eliminate them for you.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.090
I'll do a clean job, I swear.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.730
Proceed as you advise then.

00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:05.810
You'd handle it.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.411
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.330
Alright. All rise.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.330
I sense

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.371
the evil forces haunting in the mansion.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:55.490
My lord.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.371
Take me there.

00:26:35.131 --> 00:26:36.971
