=Episode 22=

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.600
Please wait.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.640
Your Majesty,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.600
I left the capital
to arrange the banquet.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.000
I worry...

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.759
Rest assured.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.640
I'm merely reclaiming
what's rightfully mine.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.296
These military deployments

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.039
were all made by my decree.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.880
The troops are fine.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.119
I am fine too.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.159
But you must be weary from travel.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.040
Please go back early for rest.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.040
I have urgent matters

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.599
to discuss with the officials.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.079
Awesome!

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.480
We've now reclaimed
partial military control.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.519
However, Gao Ji has
controlled the court for long.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.079
It will take much longer

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.519
to topple him.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.680
More court officials support you now.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.159
Gao Ji dares not act recklessly.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.959
He can't deploy troops now,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.480
and his power is waning.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.079
We should proceed with careful strategy.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:02.840
Nan,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.560
after we regain power,

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:06.680
you should

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.120
take the throne.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.240
You'd actually make a better Emperor.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.199
I've thought it through.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.360
Maybe it all started because of me.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.319
The Pingxiang rebellion,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.520
and Gao Ji's betrayal...

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.159
Maybe heaven spared my life

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.680
to grant me redemption.

00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:40.160
Come on.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.159
Nan, where are you going?

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.319
The wine is gone.

00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:14.919
I know what you're thinking.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.680
Don't you feel

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.439
that current Shi Nan

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.160
is more fit to be Emperor?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.680
He's shed his former arrogance,

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.639
and is more decisive than I am.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.759
I know

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.280
you're still guilty of that shot

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.039
ten years ago.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.199
But I think

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.199
he no longer

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.439
desires the throne anymore.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.520
Why?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.560
You're biological brothers,

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.439
but I was raised under his guidance.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.560
I know him better.

00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:01.479
Oh, no.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.840
Lock him up.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.728
Yes!

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.879
Don't...

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.520
D-Don't kill me.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.199
Sir,

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.680
I come willingly.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.800
I bear crucial information

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.879
for the Prince Regent.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.800
Why should I trust you?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.839
All these years,

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.319
I've been lurking around Shi Nan

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.680
and addressed him as Master,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.240
solely to capture this rebel

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.120
and take him to the Prince Regent.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.040
Then tell me.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.240
Did you abduct Her Grace?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.720
No!

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.360
Shi Nan ordered everything.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.360
It has nothing to do with me.

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.560
Yet you carried out the capture.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.879
Sir, please spare me.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:51.639
I...

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.600
I am truly useful to you.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.439
I am truly useful to you.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.920
Who's there?

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:03.000
Why it took Nan

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.519
so long to fetch wine?

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.519
Let me find him.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.560
I'll go with you.

00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:16.319
You treacherous one!

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.360
A dog would show more loyalty!

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.480
A former emperor

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.120
is staging midnight raids?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.759
Who is he really?

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.439
Who is he?

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:46.839
Well,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.759
he should call you brother.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.600
You want me to kill him so much?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.696
Does he know

00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:11.319
some grave secret of yours?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.224
What a moonlit,

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.240
star-sparse night.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.240
You two,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
quite a romantic scene.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.839
Greetings.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.800
Lord Father, what brings you here

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.240
so late at night?

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:33.920
Nothing.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.439
I merely wish to present you
with a small gift.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:38.879
A gift?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.680
An old acquaintance

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.160
wishes to invite
your waiting maid Cheng Ge

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:58.680
for a reunion.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.079
Guards.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.360
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.399
Seize her.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:05.439
Yes!

00:07:08.704 --> 00:07:09.720
Take her away.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.680
Go.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.104
Get inside.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.800
Master!

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.199
Are you okay?

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:38.680
Gao Ji,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.720
I'm His Majesty's waiting maid.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.839
Why arrest me without evidence?

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.104
Kneel!

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.928
Step aside!

00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:05.920
Shi Yu.

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:06.800
Gao Ji!

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.759
What do you mean?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.920
Your Majesty,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.120
I'm easing your burdens.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.439
Speak.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.079
My lord,

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.800
this person is Cheng Ge,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.800
an assassin from Imperial Weaving House.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.800
Disguised as a waiting maid,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.040
she came to assassinate His Majesty.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.439
You...

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.959
You mean

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.680
the closest person to His Majesty

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.600
is actually a female assassin?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.399
Yes.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:38.960
Your Majesty,

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:41.240
what punishment does assassinating

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.960
the Emperor deserve?

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.639
Since that's the case,

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:53.759
for Your Majesty's safety,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.200
I dare

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.360
to tie this female assassin up first.

00:09:03.072 --> 00:09:04.000
Let her go.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.440
Deal with me as you wish.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.279
Gao Ji!

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.559
Don't you know who you tied up?

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.240
This is my brother,
the former Emperor Shi Nan!

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:25.039
We all remember
the late Emperor's appearance.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.159
Your Majesty,

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:28.759
have you forgotten

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:31.759
that incompetent Shi Nan was already

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.600
killed

00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:35.440
by your shot years ago?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.799
You lack discernment in people,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.519
unable to distinguish loyalty
from treachery.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
This imperial seal

00:09:50.752 --> 00:09:52.960
should be entrusted to me
for safekeeping.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.360
Tomorrow at noon,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.840
in the imperial courtyard.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.759
Stop!

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.639
I have heard what happened

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:17.080
in the dungeon just now.

00:10:18.624 --> 00:10:20.480
He merely wanted
to reclaim the imperial seal,

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.600
yet resorted to such despicable methods.

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.120
All these days,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.519
I've followed your orders

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:29.039
to investigate Gao Ji.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.039
Though Gao Ji acts arrogantly daily,

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.879
he always acts through his cronies

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:35.399
to commit treasonous deeds.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.039
Obtaining concrete evidence

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:37.879
and crushing him

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.744
will require more time.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.712
General Yan,

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:45.159
I'll find a way first

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.240
to keep Shi Nan and Cheng Ge's lives.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.440
Let the rest serve the greater cause.

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.848
The plan remains unchanged.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:52.879
Please wait a bit longer.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:54.200
The situation will change soon.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.679
Your Majesty,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.879
the Prince Regent said

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.600
only you may approach.

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.360
Greetings,

00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:28.360
Your Majesty.

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:30.399
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.120
I brought the seal.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.600
Release them.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.480
Imperial Weaving House's Master
and assassin Cheng Ge

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.200
plotted to assassinate His Majesty.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.480
His Majesty is young and lacks judgment,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720
misplacing his trust.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.559
The imperial seal shall now
be managed by the Prince Regent

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:54.879
to secure the realm.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.200
I

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.360
will not fail Your Majesty.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.936
I will perform virtuous deeds

00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.519
and seek prosperity for the people.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.720
- We shall not fail Your Majesty
- We shall not fail Your Majesty

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:05.200
- and seek prosperity for the people.
- and seek prosperity for the people.
