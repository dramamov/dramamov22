00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.580
Have you seen her?

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.780
Yes.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.390
Do you know where she is?

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.220
How would I know?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.140
Didn't you say you've seen her?

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580
Yes, I have seen her.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.860
It was in the wanted notice

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.300
you drew.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.300
We've looked at it carefully.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.750
Are you messing with me?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.390
I didn't, officer.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.750
Your name is Kong Que, right?

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.940
It's Kong Tai, officer.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.030
Kong Tai.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.030
Usually, people call you Feichuan?

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.230
Yes.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.390
Your seafood business

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.390
is quite big.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.580
Not really.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.790
I'm just selling

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.580
some small fish and shrimp.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.390
Small fish and shrimp.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.950
Apart from aquatic products,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.390
is there any other business?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.510
Nope.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.860
What matters

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.460
about business is being focused.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.860
Only then can we make profits.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.700
Do you smuggle

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.420
people abroad?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.790
Officer,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.230
don't talk nonsense.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.020
I'd never do anything illegal.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.270
In Qin Hong's room,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.740
we found a note

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.740
with your name and phone number on it.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.460
Has Qin Hong ever contacted you?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.300
Think carefully before you answer.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.700
If we find out
that you hid this from us,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.740
you will be held legally responsible.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.930
Think it through before you speak.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.420
I really don't know this woman.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.300
Obviously, you're not telling the truth.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.300
Every word I've said
is the truth, officer.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.140
Alright.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.420
Just wait.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.740
Let's go.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.140
Be careful, officer.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.270
The stairs are very slippery.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.740
This man is too cunning.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.420
Xiaoxiao,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.700
have someone keep an eye on him.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.700
Got it.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.310
We'll keep a close watch on him.

Let's go to the hospital for a check-up.

You just take painkillers

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.460
whenever your stomach hurts.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.910
It's fine.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.740
I was just too busy

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.740
to eat today.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.060
I'm feeling much better now.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.030
You're already so tired.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.590
Why not take a leave

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.400
and rest at home for a few days?

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.350
As you know, this is an old issue.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.620
I'm really fine.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.550
You want to take Mengmeng

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.300
to Xiamen for treatment, right?

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.620
Let's get ready to move there.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.380
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.940
Wait for what?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.060
I think you were right last time.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.060
Mengmeng's treatment

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.820
will cost a lot.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.590
The living standard in Xiamen
is also higher than here.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.260
What I said last time
was not well thought out.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.860
We can wait a bit longer.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500
If you have some trouble,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.940
don't hide it from me.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.820
Weicheng, do you know?

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.060
Not every drifting bottle

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.940
can be taken away by the current.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.100
Really?

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.380
But Haizi Cliff is different.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.820
The drifting bottles thrown here

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.820
will all disappear,

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.260
so wishes are easier to come true.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.500
What wish do you want to make?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.470
I want to make a wish

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.940
related to you.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.150
Can I borrow something from you?

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.220
Sure.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.380
Wait; why did you...?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.180
Weicheng.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.500
I've always wanted to find
someone I can rely on.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500
Do you think

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.380
heaven would agree?

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.900
Lin Chang,

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.150
you can rely on me.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.030
The drifting bottle is gone.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.380
Yes.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.380
Even heaven is blessing us.

If it's too short,
it'll be uncomfortable to wear.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.590
So,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.260
it must be just right.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.900
Mr. Ma.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.340
I'm here to look at the clothes

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.260
and something else.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.070
Mr. Wang,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.070
our clothes

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.700
are the same.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.070
This style is popular right now.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.070
It shows you both
have equally good taste.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.030
Indeed.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.470
The same shirt worn by different people

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.380
looks different.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.630
What do you want to eat tonight?

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.540
I need to ask Mr. Wang.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.190
He's invited me to dinner.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:13.830
What are we eating?

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.990
What do you like to eat?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.070
Why not Japanese cuisine?

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.190
I heard
about a new Japanese cuisine restaurant.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.190
It's too expensive,
so I haven't splurged on it.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.590
Let me take advantage of Mr. Wang.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.590
It's just a meal.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.710
It won't cost much.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.660
Being able to have a meal with you

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.900
is my good fortune.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.470
Mr. Ma, join us.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.330
- Forget it.
- No.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.540
I'll go get you a bigger size.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.540
What do you mean?

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.350
You called me Mr. Ma in front of him

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.950
and made him wear the same shirt as me.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:56.750
I run a business.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.570
I can't decide
what my customers want to buy.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.640
Don't be unreasonable.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.150
Let go.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.430
You're hurting me.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.540
Mr. Wang.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:13.950
Thank you.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.900
This shirt

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.070
is so great.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.070
Weicheng, are you there?

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.990
The door isn't locked.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.710
Weicheng,
why are you eating instant noodles?

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.540
Stop eating that.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.110
I bought this for you.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.830
Your favorite rice noodles.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.590
Eat it while it's hot.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.190
What's wrong?

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.660
You finished fooling around with Wang

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.950
and came back to see how pitiful I am?

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.070
Ma Weicheng, how could you say that?

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.590
Maybe you're not very calm today.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.270
I'm leaving now.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.590
You must make things clear to me today.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.780
Are you serious about me?

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.350
Or are you just playing with me?

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.430
Let's wait until you calm down.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.900
I can't calm down anymore.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.190
Tell me.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.070
Tell me. Are you playing with me?

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.910
Ma Weicheng!

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.190
Are you playing with me?

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.030
Ma Weicheng!

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.190
Come here.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.190
Come here.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.070
Where are you going?

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.350
Are you going to find Wang?

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.470
Is he better than me?

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.990
Ma Weicheng, let go of me!

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.310
You even came to me yourself.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.310
Let go of me!

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.190
Alright.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.190
Come on.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.310
Let go of me!

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.150
Why?

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.950
You like him, right?

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.310
Ma Weicheng!

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.150
Do you like him?

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.430
Let go of me!

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.710
Tell me. Do you like him?

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.470
Let go of me!

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.470
Ma Weicheng!

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.350
What's wrong with you?

Your medicine.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:54.990
Here.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.830
Take it.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.570
You really have heart disease?

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.350
I told you a long time ago.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.780
Why don't you believe me?

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.620
The doctor said

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.470
medicine is advanced nowadays.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.590
Surgery can be done with a heart donor.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.470
I used to think

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.590
I could live as far as I could go.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.830
It wouldn't matter if I died.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.950
But now I've met you, haven't I?

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.830
So, I want to stay alive.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.950
But the surgery costs 150,000 yuan.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.590
Then I thought

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.900
about getting more money.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.310
I was thinking

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.590
that maybe I could flatter Mr. Wang

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.470
and get some rent waived.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.470
Then I might have 150,000 yuan.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.830
Because I want to keep going with you.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.290
If you're short of money, just tell me.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.710
150,000 yuan.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.670
I'll give it to you.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.470
I didn't take your money before.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.070
I'm even less likely to now.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.660
If I take your money,

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.830
I'll get beaten.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.470
I can't stand it.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.710
I don't know about your trouble.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.070
If I had known earlier,

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.830
I wouldn't have done this.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.190
When we're together,

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.190
what's mine is yours.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.590
You can surely use my money, right?

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.470
I don't believe you.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.780
I was too impulsive just now.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.950
I'm sorry.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.540
I swear

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.330
that there will never be a next time.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.590
Absolutely.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.470
Please believe me.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.310
Please.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.470
I beg you.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.540
Sorry.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.430
It's my fault.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.470
Sorry, give me another chance.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.670
Okay?

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.230
Bear with it.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.540
The medicine hurts a bit,

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.590
but it won't leave a scar.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.470
It's fine.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.740
Hong.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.190
If you fall again,
try to protect your head first

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.540
and fall onto softer furniture.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.310
The injury won't be so serious.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.550
Alright.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.860
When I heard about things
like this before,

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.590
I used to think

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.110
that if it were me,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.470
I'd definitely go against him

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:08.900
and fight him.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.310
Unexpectedly,

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.590
when it really happened to me,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.900
I truly couldn't win.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.350
At the moment

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.780
he pinned me down,

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.470
I realized how painful it felt

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.170
and how helpless I was.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.070
I was really afraid
he'd kill me the next second.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.430
This was only my first time.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.470
This past year

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.710
must've been very hard on you.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.780
Here is his 150,000.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.300
Didn't he take 100,000 from you?

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.670
The remaining 50,000
can be considered interest.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.940
It can't be considered compensation,

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.580
but

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.420
I think

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.950
this should be all the money he has.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.540
Why would he give you this money?

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.340
Don't worry about that.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.230
It's thanks to my acting skills

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.300
and a few tears.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.300
When will this get better?

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.870
Our next step should be
to find a witness.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.340
Don't worry about that.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.390
Once a man hits a woman,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.390
he'll do it over and over again.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.120
I already have someone in mind.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.100
Don't worry.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.220
(Tian Cai)

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.260
Have you scheduled that surgery?

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.440
I'm asking you a question.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.710
Why do you keep asking about that?

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.540
I care about you.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.380
I've registered.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.710
The doctor said I have to wait
for a heart donor.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:11.550
Just wait.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.780
We still have to wait after paying?

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.020
If you don't pay,
how can they let you wait?

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.710
But isn't that basically a scam?

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.690
Is there interest
if the money is kept with him?

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.910
Ma Weicheng,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.390
are you concerned about my health
or about the money?

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.230
Of course,
I'm most concerned about your health.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.340
Right?

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.470
I'm just anxious.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.540
If so, don't ask.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.180
The more you ask,
the more anxious I get.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.780
(Tian Cai)

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.470
Ms. Lin, are you there?

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.070
Yes.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.260
Don't come out; I'll send him away.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.220
(Tian Cai)

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.150
Mr. Wang.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.780
Today is a special day.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.390
What day is it?

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.910
It's okay if you don't remember.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:28.750
I remember.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.600
May this day and this moment

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.710
come every year.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.710
You are so beautiful.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.950
Happy birthday to you.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.550
I...

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.990
Thank you.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.870
Do you like it?

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.990
Yes.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.470
Mr. Wang,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.710
how did you know today is my birthday?

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.780
When you rented the place,
you gave me a copy of your ID card.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.230
I remembered it at that time.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.470
How thoughtful.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.340
Ms. Lin, let's have dinner together.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.340
Tonight?

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.870
Why are you here?

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.390
Happy birthday.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.180
(Tian Cai)

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.470
Mr. Ma, what are you doing?

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.630
Scratching my car?

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.100
When did you see me do that?

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.470
What are you doing?

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.630
You need evidence to say that.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.250
What are you doing in broad daylight?

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.430
Do you want to hit me?

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.430
I don't need evidence to beat scum.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.790
Come on, hit me here.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.650
I just scratched it.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.100
I'll pay you whatever it costs.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.710
Mr. Ma, Mr. Ma.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.430
Let go. I must deal with him today.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.340
Mr. Ma, calm down.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.470
- Let go of me.
- Calm down.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.100
Let go of me! Let go!

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.540
What do you want?

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.470
Just wait.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.990
I'll be waiting.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:09.780
Ms. Lin.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.740
Ms. Lin.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.230
My friend sent me some fruit.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.630
I brought you a box.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.150
Mr. Wang, thank you.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.190
Just leave it here.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.990
Why are you wearing sunglasses indoors?

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.830
Nothing.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.940
What happened to your face?

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.310
I...

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.630
When I got up,

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.350
I accidentally bumped into something

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.190
and

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.260
got injured.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.020
Obviously, someone hit you.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.780
Tell me who did it.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.630
I'll go find him.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.620
No.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.780
I just bumped into something.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.140
It must've been Ma Weicheng.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.530
I'll go settle the score with him.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.500
Mr. Wang,
please don't stand up for me again.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.780
I'm afraid that if you go,

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.020
he will...

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.470
Yesterday,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.470
after you punched him,

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.390
he got quite angry.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.670
I thought

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.260
I should go and comfort him.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.710
But he...

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.710
He acted rather extremely.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.020
How did you come to like him?

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.230
Actually,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.740
when Mr. Ma is not angry,

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.190
he's pretty nice to me.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.340
It only happens occasionally.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.670
You're too naive.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.550
Once a man is used to hitting a woman,

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.190
he'll never change.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.470
He will change.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.230
Mr. Ma has sworn.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.340
He said

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.990
he will never do this again.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.910
So, I decided
to give him another chance.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.190
It's my choice after all.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.390
Thank you, Mr. Wang,

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.990
for caring about me like this.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.190
However...

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.710
Please head back now.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.500
I'm afraid that if he sees it,

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.670
it'll be hard for me to explain.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.340
Let's take Mom home.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.300
(Yuebishi)

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.340
Where is Zhang Yan?

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.670
Why are you here?

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:25.250
Zhang Yan asked for leave and left early

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.530
for something in the afternoon.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.630
She left?

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.430
You must've been busy lately,

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.180
so you're always
doing inventory at night.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:35.950
Busy? No.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.020
We're not doing inventory.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.390
Why is my mom always working overtime?

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.020
What do you want to eat tonight?

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.020
I'll cook.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.710
You go ahead and eat.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.710
Don't wait for me.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.190
Chen took a day off today.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.990
I am covering her shift.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.470
How about not going?

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.430
You've been having stomachaches

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.180
and haven't had time
to go to the hospital.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.430
I've promised her.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:17.540
I won't go next time.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.870
I still remember the scene

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.470
of Huang Shuquan's death clearly,

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.230
so let me arrange the scene this time.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.190
The most important thing is how

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.910
to let them discover
my identity afterward.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.150
Do you still have your bank card?

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.710
I have one.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.940
The police have been chasing you
for over a year.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.340
Once you make a transfer,

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.670
they will definitely come.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.190
Give this card to Ma Weicheng.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.500
Then I'll tell him

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.190
I don't want his money anymore?

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.580
Right.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.500
You haven't told Danshun?

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.910
But he already suspects me.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.950
I still want to stall for a while.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.870
I'll go back early today.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.030
Hong.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.670
Didn't you leave?

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.190
What's going on?

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.710
Danshun.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.340
I can tell you,

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:23.630
but

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.260
you must promise me
not to act impulsively.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.230
You want to take Mengmeng

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.670
to Xiamen for treatment, right?

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.100
Let's get ready

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.100
to move there.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.190
As you know, this is an old issue.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.470
I'm really fine.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.950
I'm going to kill Ma Weicheng.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.630
Go home.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.190
Hong has already told me.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.390
I know.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.470
How did you endure it alone?

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.630
I didn't realize you had gone
through so much pain.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.710
I deliberately kept it from you.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.390
How could you be smarter than me?

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.020
Let's go to the hospital again tomorrow.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.730
- I'll find you the best doctor.
- Danshun.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:28.020
I don't want to go anymore.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.150
Just think of me as timid.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.950
I don't want to be sentenced
to death again.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.990
Is this really what you want?

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.260
You can definitely understand me,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:50.790
right?

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.780
I used to live for others

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.710
and suppress myself.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.050
This might be the last time in my life

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.810
that I persist.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.470
Danshun,

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.190
I want you to support me.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.710
I'll take it as you agreed.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.950
I knew you'd agree with me.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.630
I'm sorry.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.190
Sorry.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.710
You're the man I love the most,

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:46.870
but I did the cruelest thing to you.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.780
Danshun.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.340
Danshun.*

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.910
I thought we could grow old together.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.710
When we grow old together,

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.260
what will we do?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.950
We

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.470
will eat well,

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.870
sleep well,

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.540
and think of Mengmeng

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.430
and us.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.710
Isn't that just like our current life?

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.740
So,

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.100
I have no regrets, either.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.060
(Blood preservation solution)

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.500
I cut my hair

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.620
before I ran away.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.350
I'll start now.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.240
What kind of makeup do you want?

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:09.950
Something more glamorous.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.580
It should be magnificent

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:13.830
and spectacular like fire.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.310
This way, I'll feel

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.580
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.500
Do I look good?

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.470
Yes.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:31.390
The fortune teller said

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.270
my lips are thin,

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.660
which means little fortune.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.950
So, I always want to cover them.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.580
If I become another person,

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.390
maybe my fate

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.540
can be different.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.750
Do I look good?

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:56.870
I want to look like you.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.470
I don't want you to die.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.220
I don't want to die, either.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:29.220
Hong,

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.500
I also want to live with Danshun.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.100
I also want to watch Mengmeng grow up.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:37.910
Why can't I just live

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.310
with Danshun?

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.910
Why make Mengmeng lose her mother?

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.040
- Why?
- Listen to me.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.390
Let's quit.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:48.910
Let's stop.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.750
You go back to Mengmeng

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.310
and Danshun.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.910
Let's finish these last days well,

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:55.910
okay?

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.270
Ma Weicheng hurt Mengmeng.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.500
I must make him pay.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.830
I couldn't protect her back then,

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.100
so I must make the man who hurt her

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.310
receive punishment now.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:22.790
Hong,

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.310
help me.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.830
You...

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.060
Okay.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:48.670
I will help you.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.830
Okay.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.060
Stop crying.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.870
Come on, I'll put

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.580
a glamorous makeup on you.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:12.950
Hong,

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.470
I might not be able to wait

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:16.620
until the time we planned.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.860
(Tiantai'an Health Products)

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.220
Why?

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.540
I've developed jaundice in my eyes.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.870
If we keep waiting, we won't look alike.
