[Final Episode]

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.972
Ye Rim, you came?

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:23.038
Why are you so late?

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:26.638
I've been waiting so long.

00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:41.038
Chairman is alive.

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:43.605
But he doesn't recognize me.

00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:55.105
Were you waiting for me?

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.438
Of course.

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:02.138
It's my daughter after 20 years.
Of course, I'd wait.

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:06.438
Ye Rim.

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:12.605
You have no idea how lonely
I've been living in this house, huh?

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:16.805
From now on, I'll stay by your side, Dad.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:20.005
Good. I appreciate that.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:24.838
But if you're living here, beware of Seon Yeong.

00:02:24.838 --> 00:02:28.805
Never go near her.

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:33.805
Make sure she doesn't notice you. Got it?

00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:47.105
Why Seon Yeong?

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:53.938
She's only after my fortune.

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:59.938
If she learns you're inheriting
everything from me,

00:02:59.938 --> 00:03:03.472
she won't leave you alone.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:06.138
Okay.

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:08.872
I'll follow your advice.

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:10.838
Good.

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:16.138
You truly are my only blood.

00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:22.705
You're fundamentally different
from these money-hungry people.

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:29.805
Everyone in this house is a monster.

00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:33.238
Monsters?

00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:38.705
Seon Yeong is terrifying.

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:40.805
So scary.

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:44.838
But

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.605
that Seon Yeong,

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:52.338
she's a pitiful child.

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:59.972
Her father's death

00:04:01.538 --> 00:04:06.372
was actually caused by her mother
for the inheritance.

00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:09.705
On a rainy day,

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:13.838
she hired someone to kill him

00:04:13.838 --> 00:04:16.405
at the fishing spot.

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:21.738
Ever since then,

00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:25.338
she grew up

00:04:25.972 --> 00:04:30.572
without a single kind word

00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:35.472
or warm look from her mother.

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:38.105
How pitiful.

00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:41.305
Pitiful?

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:46.938
How dare you say 'pitiful'?

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:53.372
It was disgusting enough
that Lee Seon Yeong became Ga Seon Yeong.

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.538
Say it again, huh?

00:04:55.538 --> 00:04:57.972
Wait, Ye Rim. Why are you acting like this?

00:04:57.972 --> 00:05:00.972
Ye Rim, Ye Rim, Ye Rim!

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:03.372
Why keep calling a dead girl's name?

00:05:03.372 --> 00:05:06.705
Who died? Ye Rim. Who's dead?

00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:14.905
The Ga family members
should've been eliminated from the start.

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:17.738
You were just a factory manager.

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:21.238
How dare you pity anyone?

00:05:27.372 --> 00:05:28.972
Ga Sung Ho.

00:05:31.138 --> 00:05:34.005
Know my biggest regret?

00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:38.138
When you married Mom,

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.638
I should've killed you then.

00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:46.138
None of this would've happened.

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:47.705
Ye Rim.

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.405
I told you not to say that name!

00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:57.905
You're already dead. Dying again won't matter.

00:05:57.905 --> 00:05:59.072
Ye Rim.

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:01.105
What's wrong with you?

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:06.805
Why act like that wretched Seon Yeong?
Like that wretched woman.

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:08.538
Wretched woman?

00:06:10.572 --> 00:06:15.272
I'll let you meet
the Ye Rim you're desperately seeking.

00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:19.305
Shut your filthy mouth!

00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:33.672
Ye Rim.

00:06:34.972 --> 00:06:38.438
Ye Rim's gone. I killed her.

00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:42.305
I personally choked your daughter to death.

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:44.172
Just like I'm killing you.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.372
Seon Yeong.

00:06:58.138 --> 00:07:00.405
Thank you.

00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:05.538
'Thank you'?

00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:07.605
You lunatic.

00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:10.372
Die, you insufferable creature!

00:07:10.372 --> 00:07:12.072
Die!

00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:49.572
Dad.

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:56.272
I need your fingerprint.

00:07:57.105 --> 00:08:01.505
[Will]

00:09:18.772 --> 00:09:20.972
Chairman.

00:09:20.972 --> 00:09:22.638
Oh, no.

00:09:24.372 --> 00:09:26.038
Chairman.

00:09:28.672 --> 00:09:32.372
Chairman, wake up.

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:34.538
Chairman.

00:09:35.538 --> 00:09:36.805
What do we do?

00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:39.172
Darn it!

00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:40.272
Ga Seon Yeong!

00:09:40.272 --> 00:09:41.305
Chairman.

00:09:41.305 --> 00:09:43.372
Ga Seon Yeong!

00:09:45.572 --> 00:09:49.338
Attorney Lee, call an ambulance.

00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:53.038
Can't do that.

00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:55.938
What do you mean?

00:09:56.805 --> 00:10:01.205
Chairman's already deceased.

00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:04.538
What does that matter?

00:10:04.538 --> 00:10:06.972
Forgive me, Madam.

00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:08.105
Give me the phone.

00:10:08.105 --> 00:10:09.738
Give me the phone!

00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:11.572
- Give me the phone!
- Madam.

00:10:11.572 --> 00:10:14.105
Please, please.

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:16.638
What should I do?

00:10:33.338 --> 00:10:35.305
Oh, what should I do?

00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:37.538
Chairman.

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:43.038
Chairman, what should I do?

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:45.438
Chairman.

00:10:47.172 --> 00:10:51.972
Chairman, please open your eyes.

00:10:51.972 --> 00:10:54.705
Chairman. Oh God, what should I do?

00:10:58.038 --> 00:11:00.438
Chairman.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:52.338
We've temporarily moved Chairman
to Gaseong Hospital's mortuary.

00:12:00.105 --> 00:12:03.272
We failed to protect Chairman.

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:09.138
Madam.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:14.572
It must be so hard for you,
but you need to pull yourself together.

00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:17.572
We still have work to do.

00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:20.838
The shareholders' meeting is about to begin.

00:12:23.172 --> 00:12:24.872
Understood.

00:12:29.538 --> 00:12:34.438
Jeon Dong Min is waiting outside.
Would you like to see him?

00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:57.472
Oh, Don.

00:12:57.472 --> 00:12:59.705
Is something wrong with Ms. Yeong Ran?

00:13:01.472 --> 00:13:03.938
You should go back to Muchang.

00:13:03.938 --> 00:13:06.205
Don't ask anything for now.

00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:08.905
That's how you can help.

00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:28.605
[Jeon Dong Min]

00:13:53.038 --> 00:13:57.138
Ms. Yeong Ran, contact me anytime
if you need anything.

00:14:15.405 --> 00:14:17.038
Dong Min!

00:14:18.138 --> 00:14:19.172
Mi Seon!

00:14:19.172 --> 00:14:21.305
You've been through a lot, huh? Good job.

00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:22.572
Eat quickly.

00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:23.605
What is this?

00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:25.505
Tofu. You've got to do what needs to be done.

00:14:25.505 --> 00:14:29.072
Eat it all, and you'll never go
near the police station again, hurry.

00:14:29.072 --> 00:14:32.738
- All of this?
- It's not that much.

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:33.905
But where's Ju Won?

00:14:33.905 --> 00:14:36.438
Huh? Where'd he go?

00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:38.305
He was here just a minute ago.

00:14:38.305 --> 00:14:39.372
I'll go look for Ju Won.

00:14:39.372 --> 00:14:42.205
Wait, no. This...

00:14:42.205 --> 00:14:45.838
Dong Min, eat the tofu before it gets cold.

00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:48.138
Jeon Ju Won.

00:14:48.772 --> 00:14:50.472
Jeon Ju Won!

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:09.638
Dad's here, but Ju Won isn't,

00:15:09.638 --> 00:15:12.338
so I guess I have to go back to Seoul.

00:15:12.338 --> 00:15:13.805
No!

00:15:13.805 --> 00:15:16.005
Dad!

00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:26.138
Dad, where are you going again?

00:15:26.138 --> 00:15:27.638
I'm sorry.

00:15:27.638 --> 00:15:29.538
Did you wait long for me?

00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:30.972
A bit.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:34.105
You must've been busy too, Dad.

00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:36.105
Jeon Ju Won.

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:37.738
You've grown so much since I last saw you.

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:39.605
Dad.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:42.305
I look like an elementary school kid now, right?

00:15:42.305 --> 00:15:44.772
Not like a kindergartener, right?

00:15:46.938 --> 00:15:48.538
Well.

00:15:49.205 --> 00:15:52.305
I'll ask Miss when she comes back.

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:57.505
Dad, when will Miss come back?

00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:06.638
She has lots of things to finish.

00:16:06.638 --> 00:16:10.272
She'll come back after finishing them.

00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:12.705
When?

00:16:15.105 --> 00:16:18.672
She still needs some time.

00:16:20.338 --> 00:16:22.538
But in my opinion,

00:16:22.538 --> 00:16:24.772
she will definitely come back.

00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:28.505
I don't believe you, Dad.

00:16:28.505 --> 00:16:32.072
Just because you grew taller,
you don't believe your dad?

00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:34.672
I never believed you even before.

00:16:34.672 --> 00:16:36.705
Look at this kid.

00:16:43.638 --> 00:16:46.205
I'm sorry.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:49.338
I'll try to be a better dad.

00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:50.705
Well,

00:16:50.705 --> 00:16:56.272
then I'll try to be a better son too.

00:17:07.672 --> 00:17:09.972
Madam, we have a problem.

00:17:09.972 --> 00:17:14.338
The secret study's CCTV wasn't recording either.

00:17:14.338 --> 00:17:15.772
What do you mean?

00:17:15.772 --> 00:17:18.172
There's absolutely no footage.

00:17:57.438 --> 00:17:59.938
Professor, you look beautiful today.

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:07.338
[The 20th Gaseong Group Shareholders' Meeting]

00:18:07.338 --> 00:18:10.238
We now begin the 20th
Gaseong Group Shareholders' Meeting.

00:18:10.238 --> 00:18:15.072
We'll proceed with the vote for
Director Ga Seon Yeong's chairmanship appointment.

[Kim Yeong Ran]

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:32.272
What's happening?

00:18:33.938 --> 00:18:35.605
Executive Director.

00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:37.972
You need to see this message.

[Will]

00:18:48.872 --> 00:18:51.538
What's the meaning of this, Executive Director?

00:18:51.538 --> 00:18:56.138
So Kim Yeong Ran presented a fake will?

00:18:56.138 --> 00:19:00.038
Whose will is the real one?

00:19:03.638 --> 00:19:05.338
We'll see.

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:08.205
Kim Yeong Ran isn't even here.

00:19:08.205 --> 00:19:13.605
I have no idea what's going on.

[The 20th Gaseong Group Shareholders' Meeting]

00:19:16.372 --> 00:19:19.938
At today's 20th Gaseong Group
shareholders' meeting,

00:19:19.938 --> 00:19:22.005
if more than 20 out of the 40
attending directors vote in favor,

00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:27.105
Director Ga Seon Yeong will be elected
as Gaseong Group's second chairman.

I'm trying to be.

00:34:38.438 --> 00:34:40.605
I'm sorry, Dong Min.

00:34:40.605 --> 00:34:43.538
Oh, there's nothing to apologize for.

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:46.905
For everything.

00:34:51.838 --> 00:34:56.505
I never once blamed you, Yeong Ran.

00:35:00.305 --> 00:35:03.272
I'm not a good person, Dong Min.

00:35:05.305 --> 00:35:09.372
Blinded by greed, I deceived the people of Muchang

00:35:09.372 --> 00:35:12.772
and even framed you.

00:35:13.438 --> 00:35:15.572
- So...
- Yeong Ran.

00:35:16.438 --> 00:35:20.172
Truly bad people don't say things like this.

00:35:20.172 --> 00:35:22.972
And why care what others say?

00:35:22.972 --> 00:35:25.005
To me, Yeong Ran,

00:35:27.038 --> 00:35:29.305
you're better than anyone else.

00:35:35.105 --> 00:35:36.705
Yeong Ran.

00:35:37.672 --> 00:35:40.405
After all this is over,

00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:43.805
if you ever think of Muchang or me,

00:35:44.438 --> 00:35:46.205
come back then.

00:35:46.205 --> 00:35:48.105
I'll be waiting.

00:35:49.205 --> 00:35:51.172
You don't have to wait for me.

00:35:51.172 --> 00:35:54.572
I'm only human. I don't mean I'll wait forever.

00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:59.938
I'll wait exactly ten years.

00:36:00.705 --> 00:36:03.705
But no complaining when you come back
and I've become an old man.

00:36:18.372 --> 00:36:22.472
These days there are too many caregivers
exploiting the elderly,

00:36:22.472 --> 00:36:25.472
so we're pretty strict about hiring.

00:36:26.772 --> 00:36:28.905
I guess I have nothing to worry about.

00:36:32.138 --> 00:36:33.805
This is the room.

00:36:37.872 --> 00:36:39.638
Go ahead and step inside.

00:36:50.472 --> 00:36:53.572
Oh, you don't know anything.

00:36:54.238 --> 00:36:57.705
Men prefer women like Yeong Ran

00:36:58.938 --> 00:37:02.672
who act all pitiful and vulnerable.

00:37:04.538 --> 00:37:09.872
And what makes me worse than Yeong Ran?

00:37:22.938 --> 00:37:24.838
Sir?

00:37:24.838 --> 00:37:27.438
I'm Choi Mi Hyang.

00:37:32.205 --> 00:37:34.572
Last time at Grandma's handmade knife-cut noodles.

00:37:34.572 --> 00:37:36.738
Oh, the one 'made by hand'?

00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:39.805
Literally by hand.

00:37:39.805 --> 00:37:41.738
Who is it?

00:37:46.638 --> 00:37:47.972
Hye Ji.

00:37:47.972 --> 00:37:51.272
If I'd known you were here,
I would've come sooner.

00:37:51.272 --> 00:37:53.938
Why didn't you contact me? Huh?

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:57.938
Excuse me, who are you?

00:38:00.038 --> 00:38:02.005
Did she hurt her head or something?

00:38:02.005 --> 00:38:03.305
No.

00:38:03.305 --> 00:38:05.005
Just joking.

00:38:06.705 --> 00:38:10.238
Hye Ji, you scared me! Why are you teasing me?

00:38:10.238 --> 00:38:12.438
But, Mister, what brings you here?

00:38:12.438 --> 00:38:14.338
Mister? Who?

00:38:16.572 --> 00:38:17.605
Me?

00:38:17.605 --> 00:38:19.972
Are there other 'misters' besides you?

00:38:22.438 --> 00:38:25.405
Hye Ji, stop joking around. What's wrong?

00:38:29.138 --> 00:38:31.138
- Tae Min.
- Yes.

00:38:34.072 --> 00:38:37.772
I want to rest.

00:38:37.772 --> 00:38:40.172
Hye Ji hasn't fully recovered yet.

00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:41.938
Visitations are currently prohibited.

00:38:41.938 --> 00:38:44.305
Please leave now.

00:38:44.305 --> 00:38:46.072
Hye Ji, let's talk, okay?

00:38:46.072 --> 00:38:47.438
- Hye Ji.
- Leave.

00:38:47.438 --> 00:38:49.105
Get out. Now.

00:38:49.105 --> 00:38:51.405
Let go, young man!

00:38:51.405 --> 00:38:52.738
You only like Hye Ji because of
that 100 million won too, right?

00:38:52.738 --> 00:38:54.672
What are you talking about? Get out now.

00:38:54.672 --> 00:38:55.705
- What's wrong with you people?
- Out!

00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:57.105
- You can't treat me like this.
- Out!

00:38:57.105 --> 00:38:58.105
Hye Ji, over here.

00:38:58.105 --> 00:38:59.972
Get out!

00:38:59.972 --> 00:39:02.272
Let's be honest, you're not my oppa.

00:39:03.638 --> 00:39:05.272
Hye Ji.

00:39:07.438 --> 00:39:12.872
If I don't say this now,
I might never get another chance.

00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:14.805
- I...
- Stop!

00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:18.838
- Tae Min.
- Yes.

00:39:18.838 --> 00:39:20.905
There's something I'm curious about.

00:39:23.638 --> 00:39:25.972
Why are you taking care of me?

00:39:27.738 --> 00:39:29.438
Well...

00:39:30.538 --> 00:39:35.438
Because I thought you'd be lonely

00:39:36.105 --> 00:39:38.572
here at the hospital.

00:39:39.705 --> 00:39:44.305
You always smile, Hye Ji,

00:39:44.305 --> 00:39:46.205
but deep down,

00:39:47.105 --> 00:39:50.938
you're someone who gets lonely easily.

00:39:51.905 --> 00:39:57.805
So I wanted to stay by your side.

00:40:04.305 --> 00:40:05.305
Tae Min.

00:40:05.305 --> 00:40:06.938
Yes?

00:40:10.805 --> 00:40:13.138
Wanna make

00:40:14.238 --> 00:40:16.138
today our day one?

00:40:18.072 --> 00:40:21.938
Today isn't day one, Hye Ji.

00:40:21.938 --> 00:40:23.372
If you check the calendar...

00:40:23.372 --> 00:40:25.272
I'm asking you to be my boyfriend.

00:40:29.938 --> 00:40:33.438
But can we handle a long-distance relationship?

00:40:33.438 --> 00:40:36.205
I can. I'll come every single day.

00:40:36.205 --> 00:40:39.105
It only takes 4 hours
from Muchang to here. Just 4 hours.

00:40:39.105 --> 00:40:42.038
Tae Min, have you ever kissed someone?

00:40:44.705 --> 00:40:46.305
Me neither.

00:40:47.105 --> 00:40:48.505
I see.

00:40:48.505 --> 00:40:50.672
Not even once.

00:40:51.338 --> 00:40:52.838
Same here.

00:40:52.838 --> 00:40:53.872
Me too.

00:40:53.872 --> 00:40:55.472
- Me too.
- Me too.

00:40:55.472 --> 00:40:56.605
Me too.

- Here?
- It's racing.

Hearts naturally beat fast.

00:41:41.872 --> 00:41:43.938
My heart beats too fast.

Should we see a doctor?

00:41:59.138 --> 00:42:00.772
Friend!

Are you here to pick me up?

00:42:10.338 --> 00:42:12.472
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:42:12.472 --> 00:42:13.972
What's wrong, friend?

00:42:13.972 --> 00:42:17.172
Ms. Baek Hye Ji, you and Tae Min
look good together.

00:42:17.172 --> 00:42:19.772
And Muchang is a nice place, huh?

00:42:22.472 --> 00:42:23.905
What?

00:42:23.905 --> 00:42:26.172
Are you telling me to go to Muchang?

00:42:27.238 --> 00:42:29.938
I was going to watch movies with friends,

00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:31.805
eat meals, drink coffee,

00:42:31.805 --> 00:42:34.505
do all those normal things now.

00:42:43.738 --> 00:42:45.372
This is...

00:42:46.138 --> 00:42:49.005
You really learned ballet once, right?

00:42:49.005 --> 00:42:51.105
I heard from Attorney Lee.

00:42:52.138 --> 00:42:54.038
Yeah.

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:57.072
I persuaded the orphanage director,

00:42:57.072 --> 00:42:59.672
so I could only attend for one month.

00:43:00.605 --> 00:43:04.905
But I didn't even have pointed shoes back then,
so I got bullied every day.

00:43:04.905 --> 00:43:07.372
That won't happen anymore.

00:43:09.572 --> 00:43:11.972
You'll stay friends with me forever, right?

00:43:18.938 --> 00:43:20.538
Yeah.

00:43:43.205 --> 00:43:44.805
Madam.

00:43:44.805 --> 00:43:48.038
Congratulations on completing
the contract with the chairman.

00:43:52.805 --> 00:43:54.272
Are you going somewhere?

00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:56.438
Now that my contract with the chairman is over,

00:43:56.438 --> 00:43:59.672
so my stay here as a live-in lawyer is over.

00:43:59.672 --> 00:44:05.272
It wouldn't look good for me
to stay here alone with the heir.

00:44:05.272 --> 00:44:07.705
If unnecessary gossip spreads,

00:44:07.705 --> 00:44:09.772
it could significantly
impact Gaseong Group's stock price.

00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:12.038
That's the kind of person you are now, Madam.

00:44:12.805 --> 00:44:14.905
Do you have somewhere to go?

00:44:14.905 --> 00:44:16.938
Well.

00:44:16.938 --> 00:44:20.205
It's small compared to your wealth,

00:44:20.205 --> 00:44:23.138
but I have a decent amount in my bank account.

00:44:23.772 --> 00:44:27.538
Maybe I'll go to a hotel for a staycation.

00:44:40.438 --> 00:44:43.338
Thank you for your hard work until now.

00:44:43.338 --> 00:44:44.538
Oh, right.

00:44:44.538 --> 00:44:48.038
I've already sent all the gifts to Muchang.

00:44:51.372 --> 00:44:52.972
Alright.

00:44:55.572 --> 00:44:58.838
What's this? I wasn't expecting
any registered mail.

00:45:01.938 --> 00:45:05.972
The land below has been purchased

Lord!

00:45:17.372 --> 00:45:18.805
What? What happened?

00:45:18.805 --> 00:45:20.705
What? Why?

00:45:20.705 --> 00:45:23.372
Why? Why?

00:45:25.172 --> 00:45:27.772
This place was sold.

00:45:27.772 --> 00:45:29.772
Huh?

00:45:29.772 --> 00:45:31.138
Sold?

00:45:31.138 --> 00:45:33.372
The landowner is still alive.

00:45:33.372 --> 00:45:37.372
Ah, did he sell it off to another
nursing home operator again?

00:45:37.372 --> 00:45:39.505
Ms. Bu Se Mi bought it!

00:45:39.505 --> 00:45:41.905
She said it'll be used as a kindergarten forever!

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:43.805
Forever!

Ms. Bu Se Mi? Forever?

00:45:50.538 --> 00:45:54.472
Ugh, she drives me crazy.

00:45:54.472 --> 00:45:56.372
My archenemy!

00:45:56.372 --> 00:45:58.738
I should've bought it.

Seong Tae.

00:45:59.772 --> 00:46:03.272
How grateful you should be for this, huh?

00:46:03.272 --> 00:46:06.238
Now even you can live as a good person!

00:46:06.238 --> 00:46:08.205

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:18.805
The kids and Dong Min really want to see her.

00:46:20.572 --> 00:46:25.372
Are you doing well, Ms. Bu Se Mi?

00:47:03.072 --> 00:47:06.172
You've worked hard, Chairman.

00:47:29.705 --> 00:47:31.505
Chairman.

00:47:32.605 --> 00:47:35.072
Now I think

00:47:35.072 --> 00:47:37.705
I finally understand

00:47:38.405 --> 00:47:41.038
why you stayed here all this time.

00:47:45.172 --> 00:47:47.838
How lonely you must have been.

00:47:48.538 --> 00:47:50.172
Now,

00:47:51.472 --> 00:47:54.072
all these CCTV cameras

00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:57.238

I think I need to give you my final goodbye,

00:48:44.805 --> 00:48:47.638
so I'm leaving this message.

00:48:47.638 --> 00:48:49.905
Looking back,

00:48:50.638 --> 00:48:55.838
all these events started from my greed.

00:48:59.372 --> 00:49:01.972
with no adult to rely on,

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:05.738
you struggled through life with great difficulty.

00:49:07.005 --> 00:49:09.105
But I ended up

00:49:11.772 --> 00:49:15.072
pushing you into danger.

00:49:22.305 --> 00:49:23.938
I'm sorry.

00:49:28.872 --> 00:49:30.572
Yeong Ran,

00:49:31.805 --> 00:49:35.872
you must never forgive me.

00:49:37.038 --> 00:49:39.038
Now,

00:49:40.072 --> 00:49:44.005
I'll finish this myself and leave this world.

00:49:44.005 --> 00:49:48.238
Don't be upset because of me,

00:49:48.238 --> 00:49:51.172
from now on, just live happily

00:49:51.172 --> 00:49:55.705
with the people you love.

00:49:56.905 --> 00:49:59.838
That's the last request of

00:50:01.905 --> 00:50:04.305
a shameless old man.

00:50:05.538 --> 00:50:08.372
No, Chairman.

00:50:10.305 --> 00:50:12.772
Chairman, that's not true.

00:50:12.772 --> 00:50:14.538
Chairman.

00:50:21.838 --> 00:50:25.838
It's almost time for Seon Yeong to arrive.

00:50:25.838 --> 00:50:28.038
Chairman.

00:50:28.038 --> 00:50:29.638
Now,

00:50:30.772 --> 00:50:32.972
it's time for me to go.

00:50:47.538 --> 00:50:49.905
Chairman.

00:50:59.838 --> 00:51:03.138
Everything has its season,

00:51:03.138 --> 00:51:05.172
a time to be born and a time to die.

00:51:05.172 --> 00:51:08.605
It's been a while since I've seen
something this entertaining.

00:51:09.538 --> 00:51:11.805
What is she babbling about?

00:51:11.805 --> 00:51:14.172
New inmate incoming.

00:51:16.305 --> 00:51:17.338
Sis, you're here.

00:51:17.338 --> 00:51:18.972
You're here.

00:51:34.838 --> 00:51:37.838
So we meet here.

00:51:37.838 --> 00:51:39.372
So Yeong.

00:51:39.372 --> 00:51:40.838
Do you know this wench?

00:51:40.838 --> 00:51:42.738
She's a total psycho.

00:51:42.738 --> 00:51:44.938
Oh, I know her well.

00:51:45.672 --> 00:51:48.638
I happened to owe some debts.

00:51:51.438 --> 00:51:53.172
In-law,

00:51:55.305 --> 00:51:57.805
I'll serve you well from now on.

00:52:02.172 --> 00:52:05.238
Did you throw a welcome party for my in-law?

00:52:05.238 --> 00:52:07.105
Oh, right.

00:52:07.105 --> 00:52:08.872
We should do it now.

00:52:11.113 --> 00:52:13.172
Geez.

00:52:13.172 --> 00:52:15.472
Let's do it today.

00:52:16.672 --> 00:52:18.572
First,

00:52:20.605 --> 00:52:23.072
shall we hang this wench upside down?

00:52:25.805 --> 00:52:29.405
Let's start by roughing her up first.

00:52:43.338 --> 00:52:44.638
It's been a while, Ms. Jo Byeol Nae.

00:52:44.638 --> 00:52:46.805
You're here, Attorney.

00:52:46.805 --> 00:52:48.105
Merry Christmas.

00:52:48.105 --> 00:52:50.038
Merry Christmas.

00:52:50.038 --> 00:52:51.605
I brought cake and champagne.

00:52:51.605 --> 00:52:53.972
Thank you.

00:52:53.972 --> 00:52:55.505
Is Madam not here?

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.472
Yeah, I haven't seen her since morning.

00:52:57.472 --> 00:52:59.772
Did she go exercise?

00:52:59.772 --> 00:53:01.372
Madam.

00:53:09.838 --> 00:53:12.538
What? Even the CCTV...

00:53:12.538 --> 00:53:14.672
Who turned all these off?

00:53:47.972 --> 00:53:49.838
Don.

00:53:49.838 --> 00:53:52.872
You couldn't do it
because you had no money or power.

00:53:52.872 --> 00:53:55.672
Now unleash your full potential.

00:54:03.338 --> 00:54:05.105
Chairman.

00:54:13.805 --> 00:54:15.105
Attorney.

00:54:15.105 --> 00:54:17.705
Thank you for everything.

00:54:17.705 --> 00:54:20.338
I'm leaving now.

00:54:20.338 --> 00:54:22.272
To find happiness.

00:55:00.938 --> 00:55:02.205
[6 Months Later]

00:55:02.205 --> 00:55:03.972
Oh, pretty flowers.

00:55:03.972 --> 00:55:06.538
- Which is prettier?
- To me, you're the most beautiful.

00:55:06.538 --> 00:55:08.472
What?

00:55:13.272 --> 00:55:14.805
Dong Min.

00:55:14.805 --> 00:55:18.372
Help me with this bow tie.

00:55:18.372 --> 00:55:19.405
Let me try.

00:55:19.405 --> 00:55:21.738
Well, it worked fine yesterday.

00:55:21.738 --> 00:55:24.072
But now that I'm nervous, I can't get it right.

00:55:24.072 --> 00:55:26.438
What's there to be nervous about
on such a happy day?

00:55:26.438 --> 00:55:31.072
Hey, both General and I are first-time grooms.

00:55:32.038 --> 00:55:33.672
I'll take the herbal pill.

00:55:34.372 --> 00:55:35.972
Open it for me.

00:55:37.605 --> 00:55:39.238
Why isn't this working?

00:55:39.238 --> 00:55:40.738
Hold your breath for a second.

00:55:40.738 --> 00:55:43.172
Got it. Is it done?

00:55:43.172 --> 00:55:45.638
I'll be late to my own wedding.

00:55:45.638 --> 00:55:47.538
By the way, Ms. Bu Se Mi still hasn't called?

00:55:47.538 --> 00:55:50.405
She just sent a gift.

00:55:51.838 --> 00:55:54.605
Who even wants that?

00:55:56.572 --> 00:55:58.738
All done. All set.

00:55:59.438 --> 00:56:01.638
Enough. I'm leaving now.

00:56:01.638 --> 00:56:02.972
Ugh, this feels tighter than before.

00:56:02.972 --> 00:56:05.272
Oh, did this shrink?

00:56:05.272 --> 00:56:10.205
Now then, for our very nervous groom,
Mr. Seo Tae Min,

00:56:10.205 --> 00:56:11.472
the proud children of

00:56:11.472 --> 00:56:13.738
Muchang's Iseon Kindergarten
will now enter as flower kids

00:56:13.738 --> 00:56:15.938
to congratulate the couple.

00:56:15.938 --> 00:56:19.338
Flower children, enter now.

00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:30.438
Sir, congratulations.

00:56:30.438 --> 00:56:33.238
Thanks, Ju Won.

00:56:33.238 --> 00:56:35.605
- Congratulations.
- Be happy.

00:56:35.605 --> 00:56:37.538
Thank you all.

00:56:37.538 --> 00:56:41.572
The moment we've all waited for is here.

00:56:41.572 --> 00:56:43.505
The silent powerhouse.

00:56:43.505 --> 00:56:46.005
Whose steps make no sound.

00:56:46.005 --> 00:56:50.172
Who silently stole groom Seo Tae Min's heart.

00:56:50.172 --> 00:56:53.438
Please welcome the bride-to-be
and Muchang's newest family member,

00:56:53.438 --> 00:56:56.105
Ms. Baek Hye Ji!

00:56:56.105 --> 00:56:58.405
Ms. Baek Hye Ji, are you ready?

00:56:58.405 --> 00:56:59.472
Yes!

00:56:59.472 --> 00:57:03.638
For once, the audible bride shall enter.

00:57:03.638 --> 00:57:06.572
Bride enters now!

00:57:06.572 --> 00:57:12.472

00:57:12.472 --> 00:57:17.538

Yes.

00:57:42.072 --> 00:57:44.672
Groom and bride, stop fidgeting now.

00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:48.805
Now let's take a moment

00:57:48.805 --> 00:57:50.572
to thank all the guests

00:57:50.572 --> 00:57:53.905
who came to celebrate this beautiful wedding.

00:57:53.905 --> 00:57:57.038
Groom and bride, bow.

00:58:01.572 --> 00:58:03.972
They're over the moon.

00:58:03.972 --> 00:58:05.772
Turn around.

00:58:08.272 --> 00:58:11.005
Now, for today's special,

00:58:11.005 --> 00:58:15.338
Principal Lee Mi Seon will officiate!

00:58:16.505 --> 00:58:22.705
Today, a beautiful couple
is being born here in Muchang.

00:58:22.705 --> 00:58:26.238
Let's give them a big round of applause,

00:58:26.238 --> 00:58:29.172
wishing them a lifetime of love and family.

00:58:37.605 --> 00:58:39.572
Here. Over here.

00:58:39.572 --> 00:58:40.705
Are you catching the bouquet again?

00:58:40.705 --> 00:58:42.572
You don't even have a man, Principal.

00:58:42.572 --> 00:58:44.738
Oh please, I might meet someone.

00:58:44.738 --> 00:58:47.705
Hae Na's mom, you've already been married once
and you're going for another round?

00:58:48.338 --> 00:58:49.438
Now, I'll throw.

00:58:49.438 --> 00:58:52.772
- Here.
- One, two, three.

00:58:56.705 --> 00:58:58.338
Miss.

00:59:21.449 --> 00:59:23.238

It's my wedding. I really thought
you wouldn't come, friend.

00:59:50.138 --> 00:59:53.772
Of course, I'd come to my friend's wedding.

00:59:56.872 --> 00:59:59.038
You look so beautiful.

00:59:59.038 --> 01:00:01.538
Congratulations on your marriage, friend.

01:00:05.538 --> 01:00:07.038
Hye Ji.

01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:08.672
Why?

01:00:16.305 --> 01:00:18.638
Have you been well?

01:00:20.005 --> 01:00:21.638
Yes.

01:00:26.572 --> 01:00:29.838

01:00:50.072 --> 01:00:51.105
Okay.

01:00:51.105 --> 01:00:53.205

I think I'm happiest when I'm here.

01:01:10.872 --> 01:01:13.505
There's no place better than Moodeave.

01:01:13.505 --> 01:01:15.205
And,

01:01:17.038 --> 01:01:20.005
there's no one better than you, Dong Min.

01:01:22.172 --> 01:01:25.705
You just realized that now?

01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:38.205
Yeong Ran.

01:01:40.838 --> 01:01:43.472
Why don't we just keep living in Muchang?

01:01:47.238 --> 01:01:49.238
Let's live together.

01:01:51.772 --> 01:01:53.372
From now on,

01:01:54.438 --> 01:01:56.905
I'll protect you for the rest of your life.

01:01:58.505 --> 01:02:01.038
Didn't you say you'd wait ten years?

01:02:01.038 --> 01:02:04.038
Yeah, but now that I see you again,

01:02:04.038 --> 01:02:05.905
I can't possibly wait.

01:02:09.272 --> 01:02:11.072
I can't wait anymore.

♫ Rising again ♫

01:02:45.972 --> 01:02:49.172
Ms. Jo Byeol Nae, what do you mean
your card was declined?

01:02:49.838 --> 01:02:51.805
We have a guest here.

01:02:51.805 --> 01:02:53.338
Guest?

01:02:53.338 --> 01:02:55.838
That star, Shin Su Hyeon, Shin Su Hyeon!

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.838
- Shin Su Hyeon?
- That scandal.

01:02:57.838 --> 01:02:59.705
- The chaebol scandal?
- Shh.

01:02:59.705 --> 01:03:00.872
I'm such a big fan.

01:03:00.872 --> 01:03:03.105
Snap out of it.

01:03:03.105 --> 01:03:04.338
Prepare some drinks.

01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:05.738
- What kind?
- Anything.

01:03:05.738 --> 01:03:07.972
Anything? Peppermint tea?

01:03:26.705 --> 01:03:29.805
You're Attorney Lee Don, correct?

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.572
Yes, I'm your fan.

01:03:31.572 --> 01:03:34.638
No, I'm Lee Don.

01:03:34.638 --> 01:03:38.672
I heard you're good at hiding people.

01:03:38.672 --> 01:03:40.738
That's my specialty.

01:03:41.438 --> 01:03:43.772
But there's one thing...

01:03:44.638 --> 01:03:49.305
I charge 50,000 won per minute.
Is that all right with you?

01:03:49.305 --> 01:03:51.672
Money won't be an issue.

01:04:03.572 --> 01:04:08.205
[Thank you to everyone who loves Ms. Incognito]

01:04:08.838 --> 01:04:11.838
♫ Now is the time ♫

01:04:11.838 --> 01:04:19.872
♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫

01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:23.005
♫ I share the light ♫

01:04:23.005 --> 01:04:29.772
♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫

01:04:29.772 --> 01:04:31.805
♫ It's not over ♫

01:04:31.805 --> 01:04:40.205
♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫

01:04:40.205 --> 01:04:46.072
♫ Come back to me safely ♫

01:04:46.072 --> 01:04:51.938
♫ So I'm, I'm alive ♫

01:04:53.438 --> 01:04:57.572
♫ From the untouchable darkness ♫

01:04:57.572 --> 01:05:03.105
♫ Starting to be born again ♫

01:05:03.105 --> 01:05:08.505
♫ For the new me about to begin ♫

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:12.138
♫ I want to sail away ♫
