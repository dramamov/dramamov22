♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.400
Mr. Siwat?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.880
Has Khun already taken you to the hospital?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.800
Don't you have eyes?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.800
Nosy jerk.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.520
Even if what happened between us was true

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.840
or that Tambralinga city
is truly in Khao Luang,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.640
I'll bury that city with my own hands

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
so that it doesn't cause
any chaos to my forest!

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.120
But fate brings the Yoni stone
and the Shiva lingam quartz together.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.600
Soon, the Four Element Benders will appear.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.840
And once the gate to
Tambralinga opens again,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.100
we will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.480
This is reality,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.400
not your imaginary world!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.300
- Just trust me...
- But I won't.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.840
Siwat just rode off all of a sudden,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.000
and Khun sped after him!

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.640
Don't know what's going on between them.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.600
You won't stop

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.800
until I take you there?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.640
Yes.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.880
And even though
I don't have your Shiva lingam necklace,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.720
I won't just abandon my lifelong curiosity.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.900
Why does the lost city
have something to do with my power,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.320
and why does the man
I dreamed of look like you?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.720

I'll take you there.

You happy now?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.640
Otherwise, you'll never stop making me worry.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.560
I'll take you to the ruins
you've been dying to see.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.400
But under one condition.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.960
What is it?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.280
I'm not telling you.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.800
Just do what I say.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.880
Deal.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.360
Wait, hold on.

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:26.495
You haven't told me

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.800
when we'd go into the forest.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.880
After I train you to control your powers.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.760
Hey, wait.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.480
You didn't mention that in our deal.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.760
If we're going into the forest,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.040
I have to make sure you're qualified

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:41.686
and won't bring any harm to my forest.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.840
Think about this...

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.000
Hey, both of you!

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.360
Go to sleep!

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.900
Gosh.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.080
Let's go to bed, shall we?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.920
You too.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.600
Why am I sleepy all of a sudden?

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.520
Now listen.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.880
If you go into the forest
while you can't even control your powers,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.120
your fire will burn it all to ashes.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.160
You get that?

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.280
Yeah.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.980
I'll train with you, then.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.400
Good.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200
Give me your bag.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160
Do you wanna train or not?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.320
And this is your final warning.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.720
Stay away from Thakoon.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.358
Go get some rest.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.380
Tomorrow's gonna wear you out.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.160
[Tambralinga City]

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.074
Hey, you ready?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.939
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240
Where's Thara?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.000
He said he had some business in town.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.220
The same old excuse.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.800
You'd better dock his paycheck for that.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.920
What about the newcomer?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.200
I'm here.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880
Been waiting for ages.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.960
Think you can handle it?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.200
We'll find out soon enough.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Get ready.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.200
Pun wins!

00:10:57.976 --> 00:10:58.600
Hey.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.640
Look.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.656
The stares.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.160
Like they're gonna tear each other apart.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.640
Yeah, I know.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.440
You guys ready?

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.200
It's a draw.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.440
Yay!

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.720
Kor, it's a draw!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.200
What the heck? Let go!

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.755
Ah! What is it?

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.960
You woke me up this early.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.200
What's so damn urgent?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.680
Since when did you start working
for Professor Thakoon?

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.240
I'm just helping him
before I get into my master's.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.280
Calm down, man!

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.440
You're upset about Siwat, aren't you?

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160
I know

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.040
you and Khun are serious
about finding the city.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.640
- But...
- Tell me everything you told Siwat.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.226
Well, I only said that...

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.920
Tambralinga was ruled by the Four Benders.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.000
Aside from the Four Benders ruling the city,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.380
what else did you tell him?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040
That was all, I think?

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.800
He seemed desperate to find the city.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.720
Did he tell you why?

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.680
Aside from the search for the city
and his father's promise...

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.320
He didn't mention anything else.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.960
If anything comes up, call me.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.560
Alright.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.480
Thara!

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.241
Professor?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.222

You must channel all your power
into a single point.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.920
What the heck is this feeling?

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:14.920
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.640

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.520
What the heck is this feeling?

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.349
Do you even exercise?

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.560
I work all the time.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.120
I don't have time for that.

00:16:07.346 --> 00:16:09.886
No wonder you're so tiny and skinny.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.480
Like those skinny jeans?

00:16:14.393 --> 00:16:15.593
If so,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.680
you'd be the baggy ones.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.480
You saying I'm fat?

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.680
Nope.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.359
Just saying...

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.316
Who's ever gonna look as good as you?

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.520
But what kind of training is this?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.040
Is being naked necessary?

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.520
The human body is made up of four elements:

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.560
earth for the bones,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.840
water for the fluids,

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.360
air for the breath,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.600
and fire for the metabolism.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.920
The key to summoning your powers

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.680
is concentration.

You must channel all your power
into a single point,

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.240
which is your palms.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.160
Alright, now you try it.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.910
Close your eyes.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720
Close your eyes!

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.920
It's not working!

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.560
That's not enough concentration.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.655
Try this.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.560
Focus your mind

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and look at me.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.760
It worked!

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.200
Put it out.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.400
What?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.980
If you can start it, you can put it out.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.700
How do I do that?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.840
I can't.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.696
Give me your hands.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.720
Your mind was all over the place.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.160
Don't argue.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.920
Though today's not a bad start at all.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.480
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.960
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.402
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.480
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.960
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.840
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.760
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.160
Your legs are already shaking from this,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.950
and you're going into the forest?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.700
You won't last long.

00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:48.541
Are you done talking?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.880
I'm exhausted.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960
Go take a shower

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
and have some food.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.610
Mm.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.480
Wait.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.160
Aunt Kate asked me to tell you that...

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.160
the water is not running in your room.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.640
Use the communal bathroom.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.880
Is that all?

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.404
Yeah,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600
you want anything else?

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.360
Give me some space, will you?

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.710
Come on, let me be close to you for a sec.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520
Rub my back.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.920
That's good.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.320
Oh, Thara?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.012
You're back?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.440
Yeah, I had some business

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.360
at the museum.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080
You went there?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.640
What an excuse, slacker!

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.720
None of your business.

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:34.228
Oh!

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.040
Whoa!

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.080
You're something else, bro.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.400
F*ck you looking at?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.520
Just do your thing.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.120
I'm done.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.159
What the f*ck are you looking at?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.000
- The f*ck do you want?
- Come get me!

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.200
Come on!

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.400
Have you ever seen Tambralinga before?

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.680
When Khun and I were young,
Uncle Singkhon took us

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.880
into the Khao Luang forest

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.000
and showed us a place.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.120
He told us

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.320
it was just city ruins.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.400
So you've seen the ruins?

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.320
Well,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.720
if the answer you're looking for
is in the Khao Luang forest,

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.480
I think I can help you.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.400
Why would you help me

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.200
when you probably treasure this forest
just like Khunkhao does?

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.075
I'm not sure,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.520
but ever since the day I met you,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.320
I've felt like we're connected
in some kind of way.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.360
It's almost like I've met you before.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.215
What are you two doing?

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.680
Are you done?

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.920
Your mom needs you.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.240
Are you blind or what?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.280
Slacking off all day, huh?

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.320
Hurry up

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.440
and go eat.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.007
I know what to do.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.080
Are you and Thara
keeping something from me?

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.840
You're gonna watch me shower or what?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.120
Get out.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.960
The three of us were the Benders
from the legend of Tambralinga.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.000
We are bound by the past.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.960
I don't wanna hear that.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.840
But I do.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.000
We will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:55.360
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.080
What the heck now?

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.240
Oh? It's our LINE MAN order.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.120
Yes? You're here?

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.320
Right this way!

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.520
Come here!

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.180
Your fried chicken, sir.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.651
140 baht, please.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.480
How would you like to pay?

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.200
By scanning, please.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.120
Okay.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.840
Hey, Kor, since you're rich,

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.080
it's your treat today.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.320
Here, sir.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.720
I'm always the rich one, huh?

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.800
- How much?
- 140 baht, sir.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.400
Have you got it?

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.320
Yes, sir.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.600
Please enjoy.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720
- Sure.
- Thank you.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.096
Oh, looks good!

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.137
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.004
It's so big.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.320
The human body is made up of four elements:

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.240
earth for the bones,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.440
water for the fluids,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.120
air for the breath,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.360
and fire for the metabolism.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.720
The key to summoning your powers

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.640
is concentration.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.640
You must channel all your power
into one single point,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.840
Sh*t!

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.630
Was that a fluke?

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.325
Whoa...

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.400
What is it?

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.840
I forgot to tell you

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.003
that Khunkhao's Shiva lingam quartz

00:31:20.123 --> 00:31:21.560
and Siwat's Yoni stone

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.200
could guide us to Tambralinga.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.080
How can I be sure it'll work?

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.680
If you want to find out,

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.840
fetch those two stones
and have Professor perform the ritual.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.760
If it works,

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.200
it might answer your questions
about Tambralinga.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.840
Fine.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.880
Mind, where's Khun?

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.880
He was going to Siwat's.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.680
He sounded interested.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.640
If he manages to fetch them...

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.920
We will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.080
Khunkhao,

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.080
I can control my powers now.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.382
Show me.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320
I don't have to look at you, too.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.640
Whoa.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.420
You're good.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.280
Why didn't you tell me he possesses powers?

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.720
Wait,

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.240
why is Thara...

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.560
He possesses the water abilities.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.520
Why did you tell him, but not me?

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.760
I never meant to tell anyone, even,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.623
but Khun discovered it by chance.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.560
If all of this matches
Professor Thakoon's memo,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.680
I'll definitely find Tambralinga.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.200
The three of us were the Benders
from the legend of Tambralinga.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.960
We are bound by the past.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.840
Coming here,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.400
seeing the visions,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.670
and meeting you two...

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.040
It has shown me that

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.960
my fire powers aren't a curse,

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.280
but a spark that begins our journey
to uncover the mysteries of our past.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.160
So that's why...

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.120
I felt such a connection to you.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.788
It's because the three of us

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.840
are bound by the same past.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.600
I want to know what really happened.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.690
Seeing these visions of the past...

00:34:06.715 --> 00:34:09.142
There must be a reason
we crossed paths again.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.000
Don't you both wanna know what happened?

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.440
I don't.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.700
But I do.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.680
Earth told me that

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.480
Thakoon knows how to use these two stones.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.247
I think...

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.280
we need Thakoon's help.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.400
If we're gonna let him help,

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.000
we need to be careful.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.880
Go tell him

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.000
that you and Siwat will do it his way.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.039
We will bathe the Shiva lingam quartz
and the Yoni stone in moonlight

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.680
to worship Siva,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.400
for the Lord will graciously
open up the way to the city.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.880
Om...

00:35:10.828 --> 00:35:17.508
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:35:46.308 --> 00:35:53.388

00:37:14.548 --> 00:37:16.988
♫We'll reunite with our hearts aligned♫

00:37:17.028 --> 00:37:21.228
♫The bond we share is forever tied♫

00:37:21.508 --> 00:37:25.188
♫Should the lands crumble and the mountains die,♫

00:37:25.228 --> 00:37:29.002
♫And even if the seas run dry,♫

00:37:29.148 --> 00:37:36.028
♫Our love remains despite the falling sky♫

00:37:36.668 --> 00:37:43.668

♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:38:41.108 --> 00:38:44.548

♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:38:52.828 --> 00:38:53.782
Oh?

00:38:54.028 --> 00:38:54.832
What?

00:38:59.188 --> 00:39:00.388
I told you,

00:39:00.428 --> 00:39:02.188
I don't want anyone
to know about your powers.

00:39:02.788 --> 00:39:03.668
I was just...

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:05.508
Excited.

00:39:06.088 --> 00:39:07.564
It's not too late to change your mind.

00:39:08.668 --> 00:39:10.468
I think it's too risky for you.

00:39:10.908 --> 00:39:11.908
I'm not afraid,

00:39:11.948 --> 00:39:13.453
and I'm not changing my mind.

00:39:13.988 --> 00:39:15.788
We'll need Professor Thakoon anyway...

00:39:15.828 --> 00:39:18.028
I don't want him to find out
about your powers.

00:39:19.428 --> 00:39:20.628
I am aware of that.

00:39:21.628 --> 00:39:22.878
What were you excited about, though?

00:39:28.861 --> 00:39:30.301
'Cause you were close to me?

00:39:32.888 --> 00:39:33.788
No.

00:39:37.581 --> 00:39:38.901
Then, was it because...

00:39:39.108 --> 00:39:40.108
you have a crush on me?

00:39:40.228 --> 00:39:41.108
Whoa...

00:39:41.148 --> 00:39:48.028
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

00:39:48.068 --> 00:39:49.028
I've had enough.

00:39:49.068 --> 00:39:52.468
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:39:52.508 --> 00:39:55.908
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:39:55.948 --> 00:40:00.788
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:40:00.828 --> 00:40:03.628
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:04.527
Is that yours?

00:40:04.748 --> 00:40:05.508
I'll take it.

00:40:05.548 --> 00:40:06.319
Hey!

00:40:13.428 --> 00:40:16.508
Siwat mentioned he had visions
when he came here.

00:40:17.828 --> 00:40:19.308
Did he tell you what he saw?

00:40:20.088 --> 00:40:21.028
He didn't.

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:25.428
And you?

00:40:25.852 --> 00:40:26.788
What did you see?

00:40:27.428 --> 00:40:28.348
Nothing.

00:40:29.428 --> 00:40:30.348
What would I see?

00:40:31.088 --> 00:40:32.268
Then all we can do is wait.

00:40:33.628 --> 00:40:35.868
Once we find Tambralinga,

00:40:36.948 --> 00:40:40.228
we'll know what really happened in the past.

00:40:41.468 --> 00:40:42.748
Don't underestimate them, though.

00:40:43.268 --> 00:40:45.748
We'll use Thakoon to lead us to the city.

00:40:47.788 --> 00:40:49.548
I'll keep Siwat close.

00:40:49.908 --> 00:40:51.228
I'll back you two up.

00:40:59.628 --> 00:41:00.948
It's Earth.

00:41:01.828 --> 00:41:02.573
Answer it.

00:41:03.868 --> 00:41:04.668
Hey.

00:41:05.268 --> 00:41:06.988
I was about to call you.

00:41:08.148 --> 00:41:10.868
I want to find out
the truth behind those two stones.

00:41:12.528 --> 00:41:13.428
What?

00:41:15.148 --> 00:41:17.828
You want me to take
the Shiva lingam quartz from Khun?

00:41:20.768 --> 00:41:22.468
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

00:41:27.128 --> 00:41:28.330
Earth, too.

00:41:28.588 --> 00:41:29.668
We can't trust him.

00:41:43.488 --> 00:41:44.488
Let's get started.

00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:12.388
Why are you so excited?

00:42:14.048 --> 00:42:16.428
I've lived my whole life
wondering if it was a curse.

00:42:17.028 --> 00:42:19.428
And now that I know
you're all connected to it,

00:42:20.008 --> 00:42:21.828
I'm even more excited and terrified.

00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:26.068
No matter what happens,

00:42:26.348 --> 00:42:28.348
Thara and I will have your back.

00:42:48.108 --> 00:42:49.108
Don't worry.

00:42:52.908 --> 00:42:53.828
You should hurry.

00:44:00.788 --> 00:44:04.708
Professor, do you know
why Tambralinga fell and became lost

00:44:05.428 --> 00:44:08.428
despite being under
the rule of the Four Benders?

00:44:10.228 --> 00:44:11.588
The city lost its balance.

00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:15.428
Three of the Benders,

00:44:16.788 --> 00:44:17.872
namely Asuni,

00:44:18.348 --> 00:44:19.348
Suriya,

00:44:20.988 --> 00:44:22.108
and Apo,

00:44:23.708 --> 00:44:25.068
joined forces in rebellion,

00:44:26.028 --> 00:44:28.988
killing Brahmin Kalakal
and shattering his atman.

00:44:30.628 --> 00:44:32.868
As punishment,
Siva cast judgment upon the city,

00:44:33.388 --> 00:44:35.108
bringing about its downfall.

00:44:36.548 --> 00:44:37.569
But...

00:44:37.748 --> 00:44:39.708
Why did they rebel?

00:44:40.328 --> 00:44:41.668
We'll find that out today.

00:45:28.808 --> 00:45:30.508
So, what are we doing now?

00:45:34.008 --> 00:45:36.748
We will bathe the Shiva lingam quartz
and the Yoni stone in moonlight

00:45:36.788 --> 00:45:38.228
to worship Siva,

00:45:40.028 --> 00:45:41.988
for the Lord will graciously
open up the way to the city.

00:45:47.668 --> 00:45:48.868
We may start the ritual.

00:45:59.788 --> 00:46:02.988
Om...

00:46:59.588 --> 00:47:02.028
This part of the forest
is veiled by unseen powers.

00:47:02.068 --> 00:47:04.228
That's why Khun's performing
the unveiling ritual

00:47:04.268 --> 00:47:05.628
to lead us to the missing.

00:47:05.748 --> 00:47:06.548
What's wrong?

00:47:06.828 --> 00:47:07.668
I'm not sure,

00:47:08.548 --> 00:47:09.780
but I have a bad feeling

00:47:10.368 --> 00:47:11.368
that something might go wrong.

00:47:11.668 --> 00:47:12.308
Hey!

00:47:16.508 --> 00:47:17.508
Help!

00:47:19.188 --> 00:47:19.988
Help me!

00:47:29.588 --> 00:47:34.028
