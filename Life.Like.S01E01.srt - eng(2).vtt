=Episode 1=

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.480
A series of assassinations have occurred
throughout the country.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.440
The methods were distinct,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.400
clean, and precise.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.520
All victims were traitors of the nation,
collaborators, or gang leaders.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.720
For a time,
there was bloodshed and chaos,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.840
yet everyone applauded.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.120
No one knew who the killer was,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.880
only that they went

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.000
by the codename

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.200
"Red Bean".

(Night Shanghai, Tianyun Lounge)

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.160
You're back.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.600
Mm.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.160
How did it go?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.440
Tell me!

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.560
Hong,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.160
you still don't trust me to handle things?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.620
Of course, everything went smoothly.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.240
Good.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.720
After your set,
head to the private room.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.720
Chairman Du from the North City Chamber
of Commerce wants to see you.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.800
North City Chamber of Commerce?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.320
Musheng.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.840
You ready yet?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.080
The boss is here.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.960
Oh.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.760
Yeah, I'm ready.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.200
Boss.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.440
Musheng's here.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.520
Yao.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.280
Sir,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.720
it's been a while.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.960
I've been waiting

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.760
for your arrival.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.280
Sit.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.640
Let me introduce you.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.400
This is

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.160
Captain Luo, head of the North City
Chamber of Commerce's

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.560
operations unit.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.120
Zhou Musheng.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.240
He was a prominent figure
in our school back then.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.480
Now, he's running the liaison office

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.590
for the Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.480
I expect

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.920
you two to work well together.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.040
Captain Luo.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.680
I look forward

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.280
to working with you.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.280
Have we met before?

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.880
Hong said

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.240
I should bring a bottle

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.640
to liven things up.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.160
I'll start

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.640
with a toast to you.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.720
Bottoms up. Please, go at your own pace.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.560
Straightforward.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.640
Ms. Rose.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.160
It's no wonder
you're the belle of Night Shanghai.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.040
Musheng's an important guest tonight.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.280
Take good care of him.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.080
Of course.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.440
All right, then.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.640
I'll get going.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.680
Zhenyao.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.040
Make sure Musheng gets home later.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.360
Yes, sir.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.840
Have you got his accommodation sorted?

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.720
Yes, sir.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.360
Musheng,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720
enjoy yourself.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.000
Ms. Rose,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.920
take good care of Musheng.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.680
