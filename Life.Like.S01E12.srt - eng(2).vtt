It's all right.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.720
I'm here for you.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.920
It's time to eat.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.880
Hey.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.720
Use your chopsticks.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.160
Well, did you make all this?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.200
Who else could it be?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.520
Zhou Musheng.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.080
Thank you.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.460
What are you thanking me for?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.420
Thank you for taking care of me.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.600
I lost my parents when I was young.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.880
Apart from Hong,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.880
no one has ever treated me this kindly.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.840
And...

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.640
What?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200
There's my sister too.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.440
I have an elder sister.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.120
But we got separated

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.480
many years ago.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.680
I'm starving, Yi.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.360
Xu.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.040
I'll go get us something to eat.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.360
Wait for me here.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.080
I'll be right back.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.080
Mm.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.680
Make it quick.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.360
I'll be waiting for you here,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.600
and I won't go anywhere.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.360
It'd been days,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.680
but she never returned.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.760
(Until one day...)

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.280
Little girl.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920
Why don't you go home?

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.440
I'm homeless!

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.240
Here.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.080
Eat this.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.080
Slowly.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.080
Will you come with me?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.720
Mm.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.160
Come home with me, okay?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
Besides Yi and Hong,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.080
you're the first one who made me feel

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.880
well taken care of

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.200
and cared for.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.880
I'm truly grateful.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.360
Do you still remember

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.720
your original name?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.320
My name

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.680
is Zhen Xu.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.480
Zhen Xu?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.800
Xu...

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840
That makes us

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.800
a match made in heaven.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.480
Why do you say so?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.800
Xu.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.320
Musheng.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.320
Life like.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.200
You've

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.240
got a point.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.720
All right.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.520
For the sake

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.640
of this feast you've got me here,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.040
I'll take you

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.800
to a nice place after this.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.920
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.240
Get this lady some outfits.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.760
We want

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.040
the trendiest styles of all.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.520
Sure.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.240
Here, follow me.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.600
Not only is this lady pretty,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.720
but she also has a nice body.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.040
Those outfits will look great on her.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.200
Do you always
have your outfits made here?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.140
That's right.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.440
Although the tailor

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.640
is talkative,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.840
he's rather skilled.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.720
Oh my.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.520
Things have been busy here lately.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.360
It'd take a while
until her outfits are ready.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440
So be patient.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.640
Work on hers first.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.480
Make it quick.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.160
Why?

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.560
Are you in a rush to marry her?

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.160
Mm.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.520
I'm marrying her.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.080
Hurry up.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.800
You talk too much.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.400
Wait.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.720
Miss.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I suggest you

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.840
to think twice before marrying him.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.240
You need to pay more to take my hand.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.280
What a miser you are.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.160
It's not easy to make money
in this difficult world.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.440
We're off.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.740
(Rose is Red Bean.)

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.200
Boss.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.880
Yamamoto called

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.860
and invited us to have a meal
with him tomorrow.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.000
He's here in Shanghai?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.120
Yes.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520
Judging from his tone,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.320
he'll be here for some time.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.760
Make an appointment with him.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160
We'll do it together

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
with Zhou Musheng.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.200
Huh?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.960
Fine.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.880
Just spit it out.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.440
Do you find Zhou Musheng

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.920
trustworthy?

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.040
Whether or not he's a loyal subject,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.960
I should make him work.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.320
