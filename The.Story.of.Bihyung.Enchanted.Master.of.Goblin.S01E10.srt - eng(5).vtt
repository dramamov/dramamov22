You're awake?

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.900
How are you feeling?

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.380
Of course. Who am I?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.100
Oh, school.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.260
Oh, you're getting food from the canteen?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.360
Yes, you're right. The goblin woke up.

Okay.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.180

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.820
Mm.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.560
Yeah.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.640
You have quite the skill.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.380
Right?

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.310
You can even make kimchi soup
taste like honey water.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.210
What?

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.310
What's this?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.440
You can't even distinguish
salt from sugar. How can you cook?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.810
Give it to me.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.900
What?

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.510
I'm going to throw it away.
How can you eat this?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.620
Don't you know
that if you throw away food,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.720
you will have to beg for it in hell?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.409
Yama may look fierce,
but he's terrible at fighting.

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.120
I've beat him up a lot.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.640
If anything, I'll eat your portion.
Move.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.250
Never mind.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.000
If it's sweet, just add salty seasoning.
Why throw it away?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.200
What a waste.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.850
Here, try it.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.450
It's salty and sweet. It's perfect.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.250
Smile.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.200
Bihyung!

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.650
You look very close to Ha Keumbok.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.600
When I wasn't around,
it seems like you two had a lot of fun.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.850
No, it wasn't fun at all.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.620
Don't talk back.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.160
I thought about it.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.390
I think the superior and subordinate
relationship is a bit messy.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.070
So,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.570
don't take the initiative to talk
to Ha Keumbok in the future.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.890
Don't even look at him.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.160
And don't smile like a fox
like you did just now.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.660
I hope you can just
abide by your duty as a goblin.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.380
What?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.760
And don't eat what
Ha Keumbok gives you in the future.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.350
You're prohibited from
being closer than 1 meter from him.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.220
What?

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.800
One more thing.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.070
You know that

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.120
the world is scary, right?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.440
So I hope you don't come home
before 10 p.m.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.930
Stick to the curfew.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.940
How dare you flirt with my master?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.080
10 p.m.?

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.790
You flirted with him?

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.430
I didn't.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.330
I'm only following Bihyung.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.440
I...

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.530
I'm so wronged.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.930
Bihyung found the owner
he was looking forward to.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.390
Is there a need for you
to follow him around?

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.640
You didn't sign a contract. You're free.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.570
Enjoy your life.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.890
I will always be loyal to Bihyung.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.800
I swore to protect him with my life.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.760
You goblins are so loyal.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.700
We're kind of like that, yeah.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.650
As a fox, I can't even imagine it.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.130
By the way,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.060
this place is weird.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.170
Why are there only the two of us?

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.090
And there's no price on the menu, either.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.320
I booked it out.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.850
What?

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.520
The whole place?

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.790
I wanted to focus on talking to you.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.750
This is our first date, after all.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.630
Cheers.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.150
Cheers.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.110
I guess Bihyung never brought you
to a place like this before.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.940
I mean, given your standards,
you probably just drink makgeolli.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.650
Do you want some makgeolli?

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.670
There's a restaurant
that Bihyung recommends.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.190
H-Here?

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.510
Hey.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.610
What time is your curfew again?

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.520
What?

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.310
Do you have to go home today?

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.040
Do you want to go somewhere nice with me?

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.780
Are you okay?

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.260
You're so gentle.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.210
Did you hurt your foot while saving a cat?

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.120
It's really hard to take care of.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.990
But it's so beautiful.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.250
Don't you think it's really beautiful?

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.810
Yes, it's pretty.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.600
It's said that each meeting is fate.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.610
I can't just let my savior go like this.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.760
Will you come with me?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.000
I know a good place.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.390
What are you doing?

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.800
Oh.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.470
From now on, you're fired
and not allowed to do housework.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.570
Starting next week,
I'll hire a cleaning service.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.720
What?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.850
Uh.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.820
What's going on?

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.490
What is this?

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.150
Tell me if you need more.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.040
-5,000 won?
-How can that be?

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.310
Yes.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.070
You're here?

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.800
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.800
-Let's go.
-Huh?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.980
Where are we going?

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.760
It's a secret.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.270
Get in.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.120
This one?

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.620
But I don't have a driver's license.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.670
I know.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.890
You only have an ID card.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.520
Then why are you telling me to get in?

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.600
I'm driving.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.870
Take the passenger seat.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.580
Hey.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.980
Since you got a car,
let's go for a drive.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.910
Where do you want to go?

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.390
I don't need this.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.420
Take it back.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.050
You're the master of the goblin king.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.460
Are you going to
take the public bus and train or walk

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.330
like normal human beings?

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.060
Why did you change your attitude
after finding out I'm your master?

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.840
You promised to stay by my side.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.200
But this is making me feel uncomfortable.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.120
Let's just act like we used to.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:11.440
Fine. Then let's take the bus and subway
like normal people, as we used to.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.200
Let's go back to how we used to be.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.170
As you wish.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.760
Time for me to experience normal life
for the first time in a while.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.530
Right. Where do people buy buses nowadays?

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.040
What?

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.430
Do you have to make reservations
for the subways?

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.890
What are you talking about?

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.820
I said I'd take you for a drive.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.490
And this is where you wanted to come?

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.220
It's the 16th today.
Where else could we go?

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.630
Samshin Halmeoni said
it was the most dangerous day.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.660
We don't have to worry
about that anymore.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.340
Why?

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.270
Because I have you.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.280
I'm not that half-assed goblin anymore.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.500
What am I, even?

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.890
My master who saved me.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.250
See?
I'm not feeling unwell anywhere.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.780
Are you completely recovered now?

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.560
Yes. I was so foolish
that I only knew how to complain.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.550
I was just lucky
to have met my master briefly earlier.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.530
How's that lucky?

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.829
You waited for a really long time.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.579
All alone.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.730
It doesn't matter.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.840
As long as you can stay with me.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.800
You promised me
you'd fulfill everything I want, right?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.400
Yes.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.580
I don't want to be your master.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.950
You...

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.390
don't like being my master?

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.040
Y-You still don't know
what I'm capable of.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.880
I can do anything you want.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.230
Just tell me.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.810
Tell me what you want. I will find a way—

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.590
I just don't want this.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.520
I don't want you to be dragged around
just because of a word from me.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.100
Just because I'm the master.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.920
I don't want to see you forcing yourself
for my sake.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.780
I'm not forcing myself.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.710
I'm willing to do it.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.880
I hope your master

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.400
is yourself.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.060
Ha Keumbok.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.070
I think you're mistaken.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.050
It's the goblin that decides its owner.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.330
You hated me.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.200
You also resented me
for over a thousand years.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.840
Yes.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.110
I waited a thousand years for you.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.530
You're right, I did resent you.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.700
But...

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.440
when I saw you, I realized

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.070
that the resentment

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.980
was not real hatred,

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.800
but that I still missed you.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.350
It's not because you're my master.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.350
It's because you are you,
that's why you're my master.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.680
-Look over there.
-Huh?

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.790
What color do you want?

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.960
What is this?

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.730
What color do you want?

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.520
Just pick one.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.580
Look at that.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.790
One, two, three.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.550
One, two, three.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.400
One, two, three.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.880
One, two, three.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.360
The last one.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360
One, two, three.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.710
It's done. Let's go.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.230
Where are you going?
