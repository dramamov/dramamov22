Tanghulu for sale!

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.920
Tanghulu!

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.720
Plump and sweet tanghulu!

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.320
Hello,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.040
children.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.400
Want one of these tanghulu?

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.200
It's free
if you don't find it sweet.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960
I want to eat tanghulu, Yi.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
You glutton.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.320
All you do is eat.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520
You'd lose all your teeth
from all these sweets.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.100
I'm not afraid of that.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.520
I just want to eat it!

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.480
Fine.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120
One tanghulu, please.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.640
Here,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.400
take it.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.320
Xu.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.850
There you go.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.080
You eat first.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.240
You go first.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.440
It's so sweet!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.080
This is so fun!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.920
How fun!

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.520
This is so exciting!

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.280
Rose?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.640
Why are you here?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.720
Detective Cao.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.250
I'm here to collect my outfits.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.800
Do you usually

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.760
have yours made here?

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.800
My friend recommended it to me.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.640
Here you are.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.000
Sure.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.280
Well,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.320
has Mr. Zhou been busy these days?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.980
It's been a while
since he was last here.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.400
I have no idea either.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.320
Here you go.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.840
Mm.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.620
Just leave it to me.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.200
Detective Cao.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.640
I'll head back now.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.080
Well,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.240
Rose

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.480
is Zhou Musheng's girlfriend.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.200
I know something more juicy.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.490
Want to hear about it?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.560
Cut to the chase and tell me already.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.040
Rose

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.440
is Red Bean.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.000
Red Bean is Rose.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.560
Zhou Musheng is unbelievable.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.900
(Yamamoto)

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.520
The big fish

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.800
is taking the bait soon.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.560
Chairman Du.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.600
Long time no see.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.120
It's been a while,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.200
Yamamoto.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.720
Well,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.600
how fortunate you are.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.000
You have

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.440
such a beauty with you.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.680
I really envy you.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.000
You flatter me, Mr. Yamamoto.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.440
These two

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.480
are my students

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.240
and capable assistants.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.360
(They're now his capable assistants.)

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.160
(What am I to him, then?)

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.690
I've heard a lot about you,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.920
Musheng.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.640
Mr. Yamamoto.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.680
(Darn it.)

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.480
(After everything I've done for you,)

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.320
(I'm still less than this Zhou Musheng.)

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.680
Everyone.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.400
This way, please.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.360
Ms. Man Li.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.720
Will you

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.800
sit next to me?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.200
Everyone,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.800
may we have a pleasant cooperation.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.640
Let us have a toast to that.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.320
(Cooperation?)

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.000
(Looks like
Du Hongyue's dropped the act.)

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.240
(He's going to work
with this Japanese man openly.)

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.380
May our cooperation be a pleasant one.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.480
However, Yamamoto,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.120
considering how things are,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.200
we still need to keep a low profile.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.780
That will ensure
our long-term cooperation.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.320
What say you?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.760
Of course.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.600
How thoughtful you are.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.000
Cheers.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.960
(Darn it.)

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.720
(Trying to stay reputable
while doing evil, huh?)

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.720
Ms. Man Li.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.280
Will you have a drink

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.120
with me?

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.400
I should give a toast
to you, Mr. Yamamoto.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.760
How smooth and delicate your hand are.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.920
You sure can hold your liquor.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.480
(What a shameless thing.)

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.120
Mr. Du.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.840
Could I have a word with you out there?

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.960
Sure.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.960
Let's go.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.160
Everyone, please enjoy your meal.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.440
Senior.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.840
Where are you going?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.560
I need

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.920
to use the washroom.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.440
Here, Man Li. It's just two of us here.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.240
Let's drink.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.640
As if I haven't had enough of it.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.720
Go away.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.800
Wait a second.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.280
You could entertain that man just now.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.040
But you refuse to drink with me?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.390
Are you looking down on me?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.360
Yes.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.480
Here, Captain Luo.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.760
It's just a drink.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.840
So,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.640
are you happy now?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.040
Among all the women I know,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.000
I admire you the most. I mean it.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.400
You've been honey-tongued today.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.680
Have you done something wrong?

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760
Do you hear yourself?

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.520
I've always been guilty of something.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.960
Chairman Du.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.440
Have the drugs ready?

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.960
It's no big deal.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.640
What matters is

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.280
whether or not

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.160
you can pay for them.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.720
Many people

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.240
covet them.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.440
We've agreed on the price, no?

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.600
That was before.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.760
Chairman Du.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.920
You sure are calculative.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.800
How admirable.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.680
