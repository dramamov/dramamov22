[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.920
[Episode 18]

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.640
What do you think of Wanyu Yuedan

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.039
as a person?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.770
A master.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.840
He is not a master

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.870
but a ruler.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.220
A ruler?

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.960
A ruler of the jianghu

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.509
bows to no one

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.479
and yields to no threat.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.830
When weak,
he retreats to the ends of the earth.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.420
When strong,
he dominates the world.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.080
Biluo Palace

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.760
was destroyed
during the reign of Wanyu Moru.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.000
But it was reborn

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.130
under Wanyu Yuedan.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.360
So you're saying

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.759
both the Central Plains Sword Alliance
and the Fengliu Shop

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.389
want to recruit Biluo Palace

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.140
just because Wanyu Yuedan

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.400
is formidable?

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.860
Not entirely.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.960
Chi Yun.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.870
On your journey from Sword King City

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.800
to Biluo Palace,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.470
have you estimated

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.960
how many people work

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.560
at the Fengliu Shop in total?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.930
Not many, I suppose.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.650
30 or 40?

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.470
If Fengliu Shop only had that many people,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.820
how could they
stand against the Sword Alliance?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.079
Fengliu Shop doesn't hire voluntarily—

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.660
they use threats.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120
Those assassins from the Fengliu Shop

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.450
that you saw on your way,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in fact,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.940
are all controlled
by the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.150
Based on the ledgers

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.880
we examined in Sword King City,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.280
these people

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.430
likely number in the thousands.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.800
That's right.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.150
When Fengliu Shop

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.120
deliberately reveals its strength,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.750
they will spring up

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.590
like mushrooms.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.430
By then, it will be too late

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.750
for the Sword Alliance to prepare.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.750
So this is about preparing in advance?

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.870
Those old-fashioned people
at the Sword Alliance

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.070
would be that clever?

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.240
It seems

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.240
that I must pay a visit

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.370
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.240
You...

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.750
I'm not going as a criminal.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.910
Then in what capacity?

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.710
This

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.329
depends on

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.680
how my discussion with Palace Chief Wanyu

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.870
turns out.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.630
Why do you keep following me?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.360
Shen, you've been

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.290
watching me closely since earlier.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.670
If you have something to say,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.550
just say it.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.400
Why did you send Shei away

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.810
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.770
Because her blood is too unusual.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.850
She doesn't know martial arts.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.280
Having her with us

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.210
would only increase the risk.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.360
You're afraid.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.180
What do I have to fear?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.750
You once said

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.150
you're not a kind person.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.480
Why didn't you keep Shei by your side

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.940
to continue treating you?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.360
Instead, you worried about her safety.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.460
Because it wasn't necessary.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.120
Your methods are cunning
and your actions bold.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.570
You've gambled
with the people of Sword King City

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.720
and with those
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.850
who hunted you down.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.909
You say you never cared about them,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.360
but you also never let them

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.560
suffer any real harm.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.480
So what?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.460
What does that prove?

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.420
Those people survived

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.250
because their deaths were not necessary.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.040
They happened to survive,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.050
which makes

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.430
me look capable.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.140
You don't want Shei to get hurt

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.340
or your friends and old acquaintances
to suffer.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.260
Tang Lici,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.650
would you really kill Liu Yan?

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.950
You're very perceptive.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.960
You're worried I won't be able to do it.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.650
But I want to ask you, Shen,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.830
would Liu Yan show me any mercy?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.900
Can I

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.740
avoid killing him?

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.909
Besides...

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.740
This is our agreement.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.080
What I truly think

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.880
doesn't matter,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.480
does it?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.830
I really don't understand

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.430
what Foxy Tang is plotting.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.870
Shei, stop laughing.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.830
Tell me

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.190
all the complicated details behind.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.270
You understand him better than any of us.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.270
Mr. Tang

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.610
isn't returning to the Sword Alliance
as a criminal.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.050
Perhaps it's because

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.600
someone has offered him

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.200
a ladder to instant success.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.420
Who is it?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.310
Master Shao

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.880
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.510
During my trip back to
the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.830
I met Master Shao.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.510
[Tingyun Pavilion]

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.560
I discovered that Master Shao

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.620
harbors no hostility toward Mr. Tang

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.040
and might even admire him.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.920
-Clean up Tingyun Pavilion.
-Yes.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.360
The Sword Alliance issued

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.010
the arrest warrant for Mr. Tang

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.810
possibly due to circumstances.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.510
And he sent

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.240
Master Cheng,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.510
who isn't skilled at reading people,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.310
to negotiate.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.310
This was likely intentional.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.680
If Mr. Tang helps
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.560
secure Biluo Palace

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.680
as a powerful ally,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.680
naturally, he won't need to

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.000
return as a criminal.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.950
He might return

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.180
as a guest.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.020
Crane,

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.950
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.990
will welcome an honored guest.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.680
Courtesy. Courtesy.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.000
And if Mr. Tang

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.800
can have both the Sword Alliance
and Biluo Palace,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.190
2 powerful weapons

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.320
to deal with Liu Yan,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.000
and also be freed
from troublesome pursuit,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.400
why wouldn't he take this opportunity?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.460
Most importantly,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.640
if Biluo Palace

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.920
intends to cooperate with
the Sword Alliance,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.110
Liu Yan will certainly appear.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.310
Shei.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.670
Has no one told you

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.210
that you're becoming more like Foxy Tang?

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.100
You can even guess such thoughts.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.220
Taixiao Hall is restricted.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.880
No entry without permission.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.000
I request to see Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.950
No one sees Palace Chief
without a summons.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.300
Stand down.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.600
Steward Bi.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.460
Palace Chief
is at the Divine Inquiry Platform.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.920
Divine Inquiry Platform?

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.990
There are no guards there.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.430
But how you get up there

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.620
depends on your own abilities.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.830
It seems

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.580
that this will be the easiest part

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.700
of my journey.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.550
Stars in the vast cosmos,
the mystery of mysteries.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.320
All living beings, filling the heart.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.120
Now,

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.180
the sky is dark and unclear.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.710
The path is long and divergent.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.260
May the spirits bless

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.050
and stay close to me.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.790
Why would the bone-washing silver bracelet

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.250
resonate with the Divine Inquiry Platform?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.070
Could it be

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.360
that this place has some connection

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.560
to the Tianren Realm?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.480
Only the Palace Chief of Biluo Palace

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.740
can ascend the Divine Inquiry Platform.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.410
Don't you know that, Mr. Tang?

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.510
If you didn't want to see me,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.360
you wouldn't have had Steward Bi

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.760
tell me about this place.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.580
You're waiting for me.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.720
Shouldn't I be waiting for you?

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.370
The one who won the Starry Night
at Zixiao Courtyard

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.370
is you, Mr. Tang.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.600
So this is the Nine Stars Dragon Formation

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.750
of Biluo Palace?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.120
Truly marvelous.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.510
Mr. Tang, don't you have anything

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.600
to explain?

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.730
What would you like me to explain,
Palace Chief?

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.270
Since the Divine Inquiry Platform
was built,

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.120
it has only resonated

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.920
with one other person like this.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.290
I'm afraid I must disappoint you.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.540
I know very little

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.560
about Biluo Palace's past.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.770
Biluo Palace was founded by the Luo River,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.860
focusing on astrology and feng shui,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.580
entrusted by the previous dynasty

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.200
to guard the dragon veins
as Imperial Preceptor.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.000
My father

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.690
devoted his life to understanding

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.080
the principles of heaven and earth.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.600
Until he met that person.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.820
That person called himself Ye Mo.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.720
He gave my father

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.380
everything he wanted to know.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.270
My father saw

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.480
the boundaries of heaven and earth.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.960
Only then did he realize
his life's learning

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.620
was merely a drop in the ocean.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.300
There's always something
greater beyond what you know.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.670
If one learns the Dao in the morning,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.000
one can die without regret in the evening.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.390
No one can resist

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.390
such temptation.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.080
My father revered Ye Mo as a prophet

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.010
and introduced him to the emperor.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.790
Ye Mo used various superhuman powers

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.520
to cure the emperor's illness.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.600
He brought rain to drought-stricken lands.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.460
The emperor respected and trusted him,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.240
and appointed him
as the new Imperial Preceptor,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.960
giving him supreme power.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.060
As for what happened next,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.240
you can't say

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.590
you don't know, can you?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.790
Yique Yinyang brought chaos to the world.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.720
He falsely accused Biluo Palace
of treason.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.050
The entire Biluo Palace

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.700
was forced into exile.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.450
According to my father,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.750
if Ye Mo hadn't failed,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.440
he would have come

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.030
to this Divine Inquiry Stone

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.000
to use his power

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.970
to complete an even greater conspiracy.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.010
Mr. Tang,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.120
you've come today.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.080
Yes,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.720
I have.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.350
What's your relationship
with Yique Yinyang?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.270
In the past,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.660
I would have said
there was no relationship.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.410
But today,

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.200
I believe I have

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.060
connections with Yique Yinyang.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.740
But I am definitely not Yique Yinyang.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.080
Then what about
the origin of this silver bracelet?

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.870
Perhaps,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.050
it came from my homeland.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.050
I don't have complete memories.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.080
For as long as I can recall,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.280
it's been right there on my hand.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.030
May I ask, Mr. Tang,

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.710
where is your homeland?

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.700
I have no memory of that place.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.670
In what year?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.580
The year when the 7 masters

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.630
of Tiandu Peak

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.540
surrounded and tried
to kill Yique Yinyang.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.950
You seem even more suspicious now.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.600
Many people are concerned about

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.660
my relationship with Yique Yinyang.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.050
But I believe

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.330
what you care about

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.700
might be something else.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.840
The ancestors of Biluo Palace

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.040
once made a prophecy:

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.290
Visitors from beyond Shenzhou

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.290
will bring catastrophic disaster.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.850
And this prophecy

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.870
ultimately fell

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.000
upon Yique Yinyang.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.960
As for what beyond Shenzhou

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.750
in this prophecy means,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.410
after years of investigation,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.010
Biluo Palace has developed
some conjectures.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.250
Holy Child,

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.830
all the trials you face today

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.550
are to achieve

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.740
immortal greatness in the future.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.540
I've never heard of this.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.620
Do you believe in fate, Mr. Tang?

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.700
I've always respected the lives of others.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.240
What if fate

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.150
destines you to take Yique Yinyang's place

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.390
and once again bring

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.850
catastrophe to Shenzhou?

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.730
Then I would have no choice

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.100
but to defy fate

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.240
and shatter

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.570
all the stars in the sky.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.360
It seems you

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.840
don't submit to fate either.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.840
If you had submitted,

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.360
you would have already accepted

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.960
Fengliu Shop's conditions.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.800
You wouldn't have waited for me.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.000
Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.430
you're an ambitious person.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.160
Perhaps,

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.990
besides ambition,
you have plans for domination.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.850
Since I saw the empty coffin,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.080
I knew

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.910
you intended to return to the Central Plains.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.240
This is not surprising.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.600
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.750
and the Fengliu Shop

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.030
both know this.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.390
Otherwise,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.000
they wouldn't try

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.130
to form an alliance with Biluo Palace.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.160
However,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.440
I know something else.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.970
You want not only to return

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.010
but also to clear your name.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.850
You want to return with dignity,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.180
regain control of rituals and divination,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.440
and resume the duties of your ancestors.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.200
Because only in this way

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.160
can it truly be

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.030
a return to your roots.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.880
Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.210
you refuse to let Biluo Palace
bear this infamy.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.510
You know the path to clear the name

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.670
is fraught with difficulties,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.070
but you still want to try.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.820
Because only by taking this path

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.460
can you properly answer to

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.910
the former Palace Chief,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.080
those disciples of Biluo Palace
who survived the calamity,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.030
and Biluo Palace

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.130
for decades and centuries to come.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.440
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
tempts you with justice;

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.440
the Fengliu Shop
promises you the martial arts world.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.750
But none of them are what you truly want.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.250
So you waited for me.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.060
Because you wanted to see

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.600
what kind of terms

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.670
I could offer you.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.380
If that's the case,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.630
I can tell you

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.150
that I can give you

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.320
what you desire.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.360
Can you give

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.440
what they can't to me?

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.400
Palace Chief,

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.360
if you're willing to join me

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.170
in assisting
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.900
to eliminate the Fengliu Shop,

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.530
I'll promise you

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.750
I will definitely help Biluo Palace

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.060
reclaim the position of Imperial Preceptor

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.550
and restore its former glory.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.480
Why should I believe you?

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.630
Because you are like me,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.180
unwilling to accept fate.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.840
Then what about the coffin

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.650
and an explanation

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:35.850
you owe Biluo Palace?

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.670
One day,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.910
I will return the Immortal Crystal Coffin,

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.770
and afterward,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.710
I will submit to whatever you decide.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.040
Whatever I decide?

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.320
Of course.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.240
You've made a dangerous promise.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.440
I

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.400
await your response, Palace Chief.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.550
Biluo Palace has chosen

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.369
to ally with
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.829
to fight against
the Fengliu Shop together.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.370
Great.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.130
Foxy Tang is still reliable.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.400
How do you plan to deal with

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.300
the people from the Fengliu Shop?

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.920
In a conflict between two sides,
envoys are not to be harmed.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.860
Palace Chief has decided
to let them leave.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.860
What kind of envoys are they anyway?

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.680
They clearly came here

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.540
to hunt us down.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:46.700
Foxy Tang,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.880
you just fight your way out

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.960
and kill those so-called

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.070
East and West Palace Chiefs

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.000
to make the Fengliu Shop
suffer a heavy blow.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.110
Since Palace Chief invited them

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.440
as guests to the palace,

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:55.830
Biluo Palace

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.720
has the responsibility

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.250
for ensuring their safety.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.270
If Palace Chief cooperated

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.530
with the Fengliu Shop,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.350
he would also
ensure the safety of you all.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.830
So,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.200
we're just letting them go like this?

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.920
Chi Yun.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.520
Calm down.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.930
Let's follow Palace Chief Wanyu's orders.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.780
Besides,

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.880
Liu Yan hasn't appeared yet.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.470
Liu Yan?

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:20.790
Right.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:21.750
Liu Yan.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.320
The master of the Fengliu Shop,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.510
Liu Yan.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.270
You think

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.590
the Fengliu Shop will strike first?

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.830
Biluo Palace is Gui Fusheng's masterpiece.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.590
It has the celestial mountain defense
outside

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.830
and the Nine Stars Dragon Formation

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.210
Palace Chief deployed inside.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.070
It's easy to defend and hard to attack.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.800
You can rest assured, Mr. Tang.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.740
Palace Chief.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.330
What did Mr. Tang mean

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.190
by his words just now?

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.270
Perhaps,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.920
we'll have the answer soon.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.930
Thank you, Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.480
From now on, we are allies.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.030
I believe the ancestors of Biluo Palace...

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.890
Master Cheng, no need to thank me.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.030
I chose to ally with the Sword Alliance,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.370
not because of the Sword Alliance,

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.770
but because of Tang Lici.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.720
What I do

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.270
is not just for justice.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.450
It's also because Tang Lici

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.030
has something I need.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.790
Mr. Tang!

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.500
My power has only recovered halfway.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.760
Yan,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.570
are we really going to fight this time?

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.610
Why did we even enter Biluo Palace?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.000
Now we've completely

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.070
disgraced the Fengliu Shop!

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.030
We almost lost our lives there!

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.210
Even though we didn't form an alliance,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.400
being able to buy

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.790
these 2 days for Master

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.270
makes it worthwhile.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.400
What does that mean?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.600
Wanyu Yuedan is truly a person of honor.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.770
In this case,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.170
we'll also be courteous
before resorting to force.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.210
After I've waited so long,

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.000
the show is finally beginning.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.740
[Nine Qilin Transformations]

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.830
Nine Qilin Transformations!

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.630
This is going to be interesting!

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.400
Gui Fusheng!

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.680
I'm going to destroy

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.510
all the works

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.370
you left behind!

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.770
What is that?

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.720
Demon!

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.300
Quick, sound the alarm!

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.640
Master has invited Qiaoyi Qiankun!

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.070
He wants us to buy time

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.590
while he gets hit first!

00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.830
Fucui.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.850
Using phrases randomly

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:02.880
doesn't make you

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.000
look any smarter.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.300
Everyone, listen to my orders.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.950
Return to Biluo Palace.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.210
Yes!

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.810
What is that thing?

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.870
Palace Chief.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.440
Fengliu Shop has launched an attack.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.170
Leading them

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.130
is a strange war chariot.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:26.930
Mr. Tang.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.880
Fengliu Shop is attacking.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.720
They've reportedly brought

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.880
something very strange.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.240
Like a vehicle but not quite.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.030
The driver...

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.030
Fourth-ranked member
among the Seven Flower Cloud Travelers

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.350
and the second greatest puppetry artist
in the world,

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.830
Qiaoyi Qiankun.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.000
Yes.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.200
Hurry to Taixiao Hall.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.400
I'll go find Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:46.900
Yu.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.070
Let's go help at Taixiao Hall too.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.720
Relay my orders.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.400
Today's battle

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.410
is for justice in the jianghu.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.480
For future generations,

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.880
we must do our utmost
to leave a viable path.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.480
With the might from this battle,
Biluo Palace

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.410
will return to the imperial court.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.310
Yes.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.920
You also anticipated

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.720
that Fengliu Shop would attack.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.580
Indeed.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.190
What will you do?

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.590
Fight to the death.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.520
Master Cheng.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.790
Biluo Palace won't be an outlaw
in the jianghu,

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.030
a source of conflict
in the martial arts world,

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.550
or a spreader of harmful words.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.270
Biluo Palace

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.880
seeks to return to its roots,

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.550
back to the imperial court,
back to the Luo River.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.290
Kill.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.010
The Wanyu clan
was expelled from Central Plains

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.670
all because of Yique Yinyang.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.070
So in this battle, no matter

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.130
how great the cost,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.170
I must fight,

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.660
and I must win.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.180
Although Biluo Palace
is as solid as a fortress

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.980
and can withstand some attacks,

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.510
the Nine Qilin Transformations

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.930
brought by Qiaoyi Qiankun

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.090
worries me greatly.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.490
If the battle becomes desperate,

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.210
I ask for your help, Mr. Tang.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.670
Entrusting me with this important task.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:48.680
Aren't you afraid I might actually be

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.720
Yique Yinyang?

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.460
I am indeed concerned.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:57.750
But this time,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.240
besides trusting you unconditionally,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.900
I seem to have no other choice.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.250
What do you need me to do?

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.560
The gate has been breached!

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.660
Fall back to Taixiao Hall!

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:47.940
Your life is mine!

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.520
Retreat!

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.280
Think you can escape?

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.970
They've destroyed the Sky Chain.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.100
We can't get across.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.670
Qiaoyi Qiankun,

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.910
it's your turn to act.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:45.470
Attack.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.610
The time has come.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.010
Activate the formation!

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.850
[Nine Stars Dragon Formation]

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.070
Biluo Palace still has

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.160
such a useful tool.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.480
Within the Nine Stars Dragon Formation,
we're invincible.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.280
All Biluo Palace disciples
will fight this battle

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.040
to return to Central Plains!

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.750
The Nine Stars Dragon Formation

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.140
is Biluo Palace's secret technique.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.160
Activated by
Palace Chief's Star-Averting Dance,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.280
it harnesses the energy
stored in the divine stone

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:56.960
to create

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.420
an impenetrable barrier.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.020
That monster can't break through.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.150
We can have them trapped like rats

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.480
with nowhere to escape.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.850
Once we kill the 5 demons
of the Fengliu Shop,

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.570
Liu Yan will surely retreat.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:44.510
This is bad.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.200
The barrier can block projectiles,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.330
but not sound waves.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.270
The formation's structure
resembles a horn,

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.310
channeling

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.570
Liu Yan's sound waves.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.640
Master has come to assist.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.070
Everyone, take your pills!

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.200
Crush Biluo Palace!

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.160
Evil Pill.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.730
If we continue fighting like this,
we'll surely lose.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.840
Why can't I get through?

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.470
Shen, what should we do?

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.040
Master has joined the battle!

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.140
Press the advantage!

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.510
Take Taixiao Hall!

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.860
You're coming.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.460
I'm coming.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:08.980
Liu Yan,

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.510
this time,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.060
I won't let you escape.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.660
This Tang Lici

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.820
is truly a nuisance!

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.240
Foxy Tang.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.190
You're the reliable one.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.200
Wait.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.730
Where has that witch Xifang Tao gone?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.640
This is the node

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.070
of the Nine Stars Dragon Formation.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.470
Once you charge through,

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.310
Biluo Palace

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.940
will certainly
activate the Nine Stars Dragon Formation.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.110
It's Gui Fusheng's masterpiece,

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.110
capable of repelling any attack.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.400
It's supported by 3 formation eyes,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.240
with nodes that constantly shift position.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.480
But the barrier at the nodes

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.550
is relatively fragile.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.510
This is the backdoor

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.360
the puppetry artist deliberately left.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.520
The people of Biluo Palace
surely don't know about this.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.680
However, these nodes

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.240
are invisible from outside the formation.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.410
I need you

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.970
to find these 3 nodes for me.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.020
Found it!

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.750
Found it!

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:15.830
I've found it!

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.790
Nine Qilin breaks Nine Dragon.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.590
Gui Fusheng, watch carefully

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.640
how I break

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.570
your Nine Stars Dragon Formation!

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.480
Stars in the vast cosmos!

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.440
What the hell?

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.240
That's the formation node

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.240
of the Nine Stars Dragon Formation.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.670
Seems like a pillar is missing.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.280
Is that a problem?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.510
Someone is marking the nodes

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.570
for the Nine Qilin Transformations.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.000
It's Xifang Tao.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.150
Stop her!

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.409
You're not going anywhere!

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:32.969
The second node.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.370
Over there!

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:54.820
The third one.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.240
You're too late.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.150
The Nine Stars Dragon Formation
has been broken.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.200
Break.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:20.970
Lici.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.150
Do you see now?

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.920
Wherever you appear,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.980
disaster follows.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:28.790
Another city

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.330
will be sacrificed because of you.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400
It's not over yet.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.250
The mystery of mysteries!

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.070
The Divine Inquiry Platform
has been awakened.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.030
Master.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.510
I believe you are not Yique Yinyang.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.710
You two might share the same origin.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.670
But I'm willing to bet

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.270
that you're not the evil one.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.190
Though Biluo Palace
was built by Gui Fusheng,

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.590
the Star-Averting Dance

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.960
is the key to activating the divine stone.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.090
Time is running out.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.720
I'll teach it to you now.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.850
Stars in the vast cosmos,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.540
the mystery of mysteries!

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:38.390
Oh no!

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.270
It's the Sky-Fallen Stone!

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.810
The Nine Qilin Transformations is ruined.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.140
Let's retreat quickly.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.840
The chain is still there, right?

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.090

Dream Soul Blood Peach

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.320
blooms on Qingshan Cliff

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.360
and atop Mount Mengxue.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:45.760
It blossoms when the moon rises

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.190
and withers at sunrise,

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.670
like a dream,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:52.480
a soul,

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:54.400
and blood.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.280
Like our

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.550
false friendship.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.190
Yan.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.360
You falsely accused me
of being Yique Yinyang,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.490
watching me being hunted by everyone.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:12.770
Are you happy about it?

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:13.710
Of course.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:15.800
This is the happiest thing

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.320
for me in these 4 years.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.850
Watching your lies being exposed.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.400
Letting everyone

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.960
see your true face.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.670
Lici, look.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.340
I wasn't wrong.
