[Episode 23]

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.070
I've specifically prepared

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.530
a little black fox for him
inside the circle.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.350
It'll appear at the right moment

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.940
and possess his heart.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.610
Madam, you're brilliant.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.590
Who's there?

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.470
Why can I see these images?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.750
They say
Young Master Fugui is still alive.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.280
Is that true or not?

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.120
It seems...

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.320
I need to go to Tushan right away.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.290

Ninety-six.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.560
Ninety-seven!

Ninety-nine!

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.190
Nine...

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.310
Ninety-nine times now.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.680
Just one more to make it 100 times.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.140
This time, it'll work out!

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.360
Do you think our boss has OCD
or something?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.280
Why does it have to be

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.400
such a specific round number?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.130
I don't think

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.750
anyone could possibly persist in

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.079
proposing 100 times.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.570
Right, right, exactly.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.150
I, Li Xueyang,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.190
hate quitters

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.750
more than anything.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.560
No way!

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.150
That poor dog

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.360
seems quite persistent.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.750
Yeah.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.910
As long as he comes today,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.120
our boss will definitely marry him,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.470
right?

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.120
Right, right.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.560
Right!

She'll definitely marry him.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.280
What if he doesn't show up today?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.010
Impossible!

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.590
Absolutely impossible!

It's been a whole day.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.010
He'll definitely come.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.360
Boss,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.240
I've noticed that
whatever you say ends up jinxing things.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.960
Look, it's almost dark.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.560
That poor dog really didn't come.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.960
Who says he isn't coming?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.020
It's not completely dark yet.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.190
See?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.800
Well...

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.600
I don't know.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.680
Logically, he's already come
to propose 99 times.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.000
What's one more time?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.820
That's right.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.630
That poor dog

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.270
doesn't seem like the sort
to quit halfway.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.830
Exactly.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.920
Then why do you think

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.830
he didn't come today?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.510
-He hasn't gotten into trouble, has he?
-He hasn't gotten into trouble, has he?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.640
He couldn't have...

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.350
really gotten into some trouble, could he?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.630
Boss?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.390
Yunfei,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.270
have you missed us lately?

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.070
Of course,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.580
I've missed you terribly.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.310
If you miss us, why don't you
come visit us?

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.920
Exactly.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.650
It's all because of that shrew.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.560
Once I marry that shrew

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.870
and ascend to the throne,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.560
I'll banish her to the cold palace

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.310
and marry many beauties!

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.750
Yunfei,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.800
will we be among those beauties?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.600
Of course!

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.490
Of course! I'll marry you all!

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.870
I'll marry you all!

Fan Yunfei!

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.950
Who's that woman?

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.430
She's that shrew.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920
Oh, it's her.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.920
It's okay. It's okay.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.610
Since you're already here...

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.090
come and join us.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.720
Get lost.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.750
All of you!

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.800
Gosh.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.920
What a shrew.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.870
Exactly.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.730
You're not going to hit me, are you?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.420
Don't ever show your face to me again.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.170
She's gone.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.010
She's out of sight now.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.930
Why do you have to do this?

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.270
Every time you go out drinking
with courtesans,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.870
you disguise yourself
as the Second Prince.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.000
Why?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.610
What do you know?

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.040
This is

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.830
meant to deceive people.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.160
If people knew I, a king,
frequented such places,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.510
I'd be ridiculed.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.400
I think you just have too much free time.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.010
You...

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.560
Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.690
Let's go.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.090
I really don't understand you lot.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.070
With your meager strength,
you still dared to pester me?

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.630
And you had to pick today of all days.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.720
Do you know what important matter
you've ruined?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.240
Today was supposed to be
my hundredth proposal!

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.570
You ruined everything!

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.570
You still want to fight?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.830
Why did I only slap him?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.400
I should have run him through
with my spear!

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.400
Wait, that's not right.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.720
Why am I even angry?

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.750
What is he to me anyway?

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.190
General Li,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.000
out for a stroll alone?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.480
I heard you were injured.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.789
How are you feeling? Any better?

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.650
Snake-Haired Fire Prince,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.650
I'm not in the mood
to deal with you today.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.270
You think you can
just dismiss me like that?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.030
You hurt my sisters.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:48.880
Today,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.680
[Snake-Haired Fire Prince]

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.760
I came to settle the score!

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.440
Get lost.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.510
Looks like someone
got their heart broken, huh?

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.360
I'm already in a foul mood today,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.320
and you just had to throw yourself
in front of my spear.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.200
You're asking for it!

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.390
I've lived in the Western Regions
for 400 years, after all.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.440
There's no magic tool
I haven't come across.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.670
Nine protective talismans?

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.240
I'll burn them one by one.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.440
And finally,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.080
I'll burn you too!

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.360
Are...

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.010
Are you alright?

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.910
Shouldn't you be enjoying
nighttime pleasures in Corsac Fox City?

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.840
Why are you here?

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.630
What...

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.280
What are you talking about?

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.120
Hey!

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.440
Are we fighting or what?

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.500
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.780
Seems the slap I gave you
wasn't hard enough!

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.670
I...

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:49.790
I...

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:50.960
I...

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.120
I...

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.790
I don't understand what...

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.120
what you're saying.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.880
Still pretending, aren't you?

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.630
So you don't want to
explain yourself, huh?

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.160
I... I...

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.670
I never thought

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.550
Li Xueyang, wielder of
the Frozen Grace Spear,

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.600
would turn out to be such a lovesick fool.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.200
Looks like

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.350
this little corsac fox
has been unfaithful to you.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.170
Mind your own business!

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.670
Look at this corsac fox—

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.000
skin like cream,

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.920
with a face as pretty as a flower.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.960
A man as fickle as him

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.630
simply can't be trusted.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.670
Are you asking for it?

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:28.720
Xueyang!

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.550
Take a rest.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.970
I'll deal with him!

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.620
Xueyang...

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.120
Li Xueyang,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.720
I'd like to see

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.960
how long you two can hold out.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.750
Don't worry.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.120
Whatever tricks you have left,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.630
feel free to use them.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.670
Water-Control Orb?

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.480
The Water-Control Orb is
the dragon clan's sacred relic!

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.030
It's naturally incompatible with
your corsac fox nature.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.150
You think it will obediently
follow your commands?

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.840
Give up already.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.750
You dare to hurt my fiancée?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.910
You'll die for it!

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.510
So...

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.600
it was you.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.500

Boss?

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.690
Move aside!

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.370
Wait...

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.950

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.360

What happened to our boss?

Hurry up! Quickly!

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.380

a distinguished guest would arrive today.

The sun is almost setting.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.790
Could the Elder's divination be wrong?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.750
A spider demon.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.730
Qingtong of Qianji City

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.090
greets the Third Master of Tushan.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.680
I heard Qianji City has a new ruler.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.640
So it's you.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.270
Indeed.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.110
Interesting.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.480
How did you know

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.210
I'm the Third Master of Tushan?

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.240
Always with an abacus in hand,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.960
calculating all under heaven—

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.220
who else could it be but the Third Master?

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.750
Why is there Power of Love

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.660
mixed in your demonic energy?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.460
You're actually refining
a Grief Tree seed.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.110
I, Qingtong, have come here

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.440
to ask about something.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.200
Sister,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.960
come with me.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.830
The Great Grief Tree of Tushan is

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.400
the source of all Power of Love
in the world,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.940
and all Grief Tree seeds

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.440
were born from it.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.790
Many years ago,

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.110
I scattered Grief Tree seeds
in various places,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.110
hoping that one day

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.790
new Grief Trees would grow,

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.810
so the Power of Love

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.930
could be connected into a net.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.830
So by chance,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.160
Qianji City

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.790
also obtained a seed?

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.350
By chance, indeed.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.470
But that Grief Tree seed

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.750
was stolen by

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.320
your repulsive former governor.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.700
Now it's somehow ended up inside you.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.920
It's time for you to repay

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.590
what you owe me!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.750
I've already said

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.510
that I came here

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.840
to ask about something.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.810
I have no wish to fight you.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.900
Return my tree seed first;

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.000
then you can ask your questions.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.110
I saw the Black Fox.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.200
Where did you see the Black Fox?

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.240
While I was refining the tree seed,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.300
I saw the Black Fox.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.000
Third Master,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.880
can the Grief Tree within the circle

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.000
connect with

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.270
the Black Grief Tree?

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.830
Grief Trees can connect with each other,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.550
but they absolutely cannot connect

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.100
with the Black Grief Tree.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.030
Then why

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.720
could I see the Black Fox?

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.480
Is the tree seed in my body

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.440
actually from the Black Grief Tree?

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.440
If you want the answer,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.400
go to the place
where you obtained this tree seed

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400
and ask.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.440
He really kissed me?

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.520
Um... yes.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.800
He really did.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.610
We both saw it with our own eyes.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.160
You two just stood there watching?

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.960
-We...
-We...

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.590
We were...

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.030
were trying to stop him at that time.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.550
But...

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.690
but he was only trying to save you.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.270
Boss, you wanted water

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.680
but couldn't drink it properly,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.440
so he had to feed it to you
mouth-to-mouth.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.270
I think you talk too much.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.110
Boss,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.490
we'll go and drink some water.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.270
No way.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.810
Don't tell me you actually kissed her.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.790
Well...

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.030
share your experience with us.

Poor Dog.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.830
Do you have something on your mind,

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.830
or are you sick?

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.110
Master.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:54.830
Yes?

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.640
What does
"seeking nighttime pleasures" mean?

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.440
Well, this question...

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.060
I don't really understand it either.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.440
The Celestial Master—

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.840
he's much more experienced in that regard.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.790
Fugui, what are you talking about?

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.390
I've never even heard of
that phrase before...

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.730
Come closer.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.170
It means...

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.590
going to that kind of place

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.050
and doing certain things.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.480
Got it?

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.590
So that's

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.700
Oh, right.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.100
Where are His Majesty
and the Second Prince?

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.480
Although the Second Prince
has successfully proposed,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.070
the formalities can't be skipped.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.240
His Majesty has taken him

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.640
to the Li Army's military camp
to formally propose marriage.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.800
These are the betrothal gifts.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.680
Outside the tent,

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.640
there are also 12 war horses

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.030
and 20 camels.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.650
It's just a small token of respect.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.530
Fine clothes and jewels

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.450
are but material possessions.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.880
You can't take them with you at birth,
nor keep them at death.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.640
We only hope

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.480
our daughter can live happily
her entire life.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.280
That's not too much to ask, is it?

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.480
Not at all.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.160
It's only right.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.110
Yunfei,

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.350
hurry and serve tea to my father.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.070
Yes, yes. Hurry.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.890
Father-in-law,

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.230
please have some tea.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.600
I know your family is rich and generous.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.700
But all that gold, silver, and jewels

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.000
are nothing

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.950
compared to my daughter.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.000
Remember this:

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.070
even after marrying you,

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.640
she will still command the Li Army.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.800
In the future, she can live
wherever she wants,

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.000
and you must never prevent her
from doing so.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.590
Father-in-law, rest assured.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.190
I'll never let Xueyang down.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.920
Xueyang can come and go
from our Corsac Fox State freely.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.250
Without any hindrance!

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.000
After marriage,

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.550
you must observe your duties as a husband.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:00.880
No concubines for life,

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.400
and absolutely no disloyalty
to my daughter.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.200
Otherwise...

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.060
I'll skin you alive.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.070
I...

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.000
ab-ab-ab...

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.480
I...

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.920
ab-ab-ab...

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.790
I absolutely won't!

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.880
H-He wouldn't dare.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.850
I wouldn't spare him either.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.790
Look how scared you've made him.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:23.160
I...

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.310
Stop being so dramatic.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.240
Take it quickly.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:26.830
Yes, darling.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.090
Mother-in-law.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.470
Please have some tea.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.350
Get up.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.030
However,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.110
as they say,
husband and wife are of one mind.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.240
What my husband said

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.720
is exactly what I meant.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.310
Yes.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.440
I'll say
what needs to be said plainly now,

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.310
so it's easier to settle scores later.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.030
Therefore,

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.300
I've established a few rules.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:10.070
[Fourteen Family Rules]

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.440
"Fourteen Family Rules."

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.550
Rule 1:

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.139
Li Xueyang has been fastidious
about cleanliness since childhood.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:20.360
[Fourteen Family Rules]

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.320
In the Corsac Fox State, she shall
never lack water for bathing.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.400
She must not

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.480
lose even an ounce of weight

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.880
or become even slightly tanned.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.710
Rule 2...

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.800
Yunfei.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.760
Don't read them out.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.400
Mother.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.190
Come on.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.480
Yunfei,

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.070
say something.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.159
Mother-in-law,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.070
I swear that

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.920
as long as Xueyang is happy,

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.590
I'll agree to anything she wants.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.400
I promise:

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.530
if hit, I won't strike back;

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.630
if scolded, I won't talk back.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.670
That's right. That's right.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.510
In that regard,

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.150
you should learn from your father-in-law.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.840
He's an expert at it!

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.670
How did this circle back to me?

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.070
Darling.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:02.600
Alright.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.600
I won't make things difficult
for you anymore.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.840
Xueyang.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.360
I'll ask you once more.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.030
Humans and demons walk different paths.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.160
Have you really thought this through?

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.110
Mother.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.480
Father.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.380
I've thought it through.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.960
I love Yunfei.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.090
In this life,

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.590
I'll marry no one but him.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.960
Wonderful!

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.400
It's settled then!

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.540
From now on, we're all family.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.710
We're family now!

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.480
Master.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.380
Master.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.550
I asked you to keep an eye on

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.920
the other little black foxes
in the circle.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.150
How is it going?

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.030
Master.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.430
Qianji City has a new governor

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.160
named...

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320
named Qingcheng.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.840
He is very suspicious by nature.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.710
We...

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.600
really couldn't find anything.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.670
In the end...

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.840
Madam Black Fox has cast me aside.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.550
I can't blame her.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.130
She spread Chakuwa

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.120
and helped me obtain dragon power.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.200
It was already a risky strategy.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.810
I can only blame myself for
not seizing the opportunity...

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.630
and being defeated by Wangquan Fugui
with one strike.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.440
Now I'm stripped of all my power...

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.030
and have no value anymore.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.960
Do you still remember the last queen

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.230
of the Qianxia Kingdom
from 1000 yeras ago,

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:22.400
Gulizan?

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.830
Her Myriad Blight Formation

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.630
could absorb people's power,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.830
especially the Power of Hatred.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.670
The Black Fox would

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.000
surely like that formation.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.400
Master.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.320
But...

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.960
didn't the Qianxia Kingdom

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.550
perish long ago?

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.880
But according to my investigation,

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.590
a huge secret lies buried

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.130
beneath the sands of the Western Regions.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.190
Gulizan—

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.590
she's still alive.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.110
Go to Qianji City

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.280
and spread the news
that Gulizan is still alive.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.550
Consider it...

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.760
a grand gift from me to Madam Black Fox.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.230
If you want the answer,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.320
go to the place
where you obtained this tree seed

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.110
and ask.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.550
We meet again.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.110
You've already obtained the Power of Love
of the Grief Tree.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.440
Why have you returned?

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.210
I want to ask you—

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.480
what exactly did this seed inside me

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.240
experience at the Joy and Sorrow Sect?

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.250
Why did I sense it was filled with evil

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.760
when I tried to refine it?

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.960
You already have the answer
to this question in your heart,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.760
don't you?

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.440
From the moment
Qianji City obtained this tree seed,

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.800
this place turned into a purgatory.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.320
People and demons were
continuously sent here

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.150
to refine the tree seed with their bodies

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.810
and release its Power of Love.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.070
But they all died, one after another.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.280
And the Power of Hatred generated
after their deaths

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.000
was all absorbed by this seed.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.110
So their Power of Hatred

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.720
caused the Grief Tree seed,
born from love,

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.790
to be filled with resentment

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.550
until it finally became
the Black Grief Tree seed.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.280
Yes.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.360
However, you are the only demon

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.710
I've ever seen who still has a chance
to purify it back

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.280
into a pure Grief Tree seed.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.230
If you can completely refine it,

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.190
you will obtain its pure Power of Love,

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.810
not the Power of Hatred.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.630
If I can refine the seed within me...

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.940
what about the one beyond the circle?

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.230
Can that one be refined as well?

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.290
Beyond the circle?

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.420
You mean Madam Black Fox's Great Grief Tree?

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.550
Exactly.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.400
If you can successfully refine

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.880
the Black Grief Tree seed within you,

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.110
then naturally you can refine the one
beyond the circle as well.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.980
But the cost will be great.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.790
I don't know if you can bear it.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.320
If it can truly be done,

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.480
I'm willing to pay any price.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.800
The fact that you think this way

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.200
makes your fated connection
with the Grief Tree worthwhile.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.910
I have one more question.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.150
In the vision,

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.360
I saw that Black Fox.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.920
Was all of that real?

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.550
The tree seed inside you

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.000
is the only one

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.400
that can connect with the Black Grief Tree
beyond the circle.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.320
So everything you saw,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.550
of course, exists in reality.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.070
So...

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.150
So none of that was an illusion.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.140
Young Master Fugui...

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.230
is really alive.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.960
I never expected

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:19.070
that you, Tushan Rongrong, who never
lets anything slip through your fingers,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.190
would actually let that little spider
take the Grief Tree seed

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.440
and leave Tushan.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.400
A black-hearted thief

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.740
stole one of my tree seeds,

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.160
yet such unexpected developments occurred.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.440
That little spider demon

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.760
might actually be able to

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.710
change the game
between us and the Black Fox.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.000
This business deal...

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.190
wasn't a loss.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:58.030
Sister,

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.030
I'm here.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.090
I've been to Tushan.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.550
Young Master Fugui isn't dead.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.230
He is in the Western Regions.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.020
Qingcheng.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.030
You've lied to me twice.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.080
I knew that would come to light
sooner or later.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.090
As long as you don't abandon me again,

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.440
I'll accept any punishment.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.960
Tell me first—

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.480
why did you lie to me?

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.070
No reason.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.020
He's not worthy of you.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.740
I'm not afraid of anything

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.000
except losing you.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.710
Sister, kill me!

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.640
Sister, are you going to
the Western Regions to find him?

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.520
That's none of your concern.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:22.110
Do you think

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.250
that just because you're my brother,

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.920
you can do whatever you want?

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.880
That you can

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.360
make all decisions for me?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.840
Sister!

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.760
Sister, don't go,

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.630
Sister!

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.960
Sister...

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:45.070
Please don't go, Sister!

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.630
Don't abandon me again,

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:47.840
Sister...

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:59.320
Wangquan Fugui!
