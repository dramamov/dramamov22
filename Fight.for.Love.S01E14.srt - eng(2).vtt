Gu!

Chu Yu.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.060
Protect the Eldest Princess!

Chu Yu!

Gu!

My Lady.

Be careful, Yu!

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.960
Hold my hand!

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.470
Hold on tight!

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.800
- My Lady!
- My Lady!

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.360
Thank you, Yun.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.920
Are you alright?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.990
I'm fine.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.710
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.260
No need to stand on ceremony.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.270
Chu Yu,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.430
how are you?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.750
Your Highness,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.590
I'm fine.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.590
Impressive, Yun.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.880
Catching someone with bare hands

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.950
is as easy as pie for you.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.360
It seems that Mr. Gu

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.730
still can't let go of Chu Yu.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.710
Indeed.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.810
He instinctively tried to save her.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.470
But Mrs. Gu...

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.140
Your Highness,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.340
we've caught the assassin.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.520
However,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.520
he's poisoned himself to death.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.420
Has his identity been discovered?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.180
Not yet.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.860
The body has been sent
to the Court of Judicial Review.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.960
I will definitely find out.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.820
How dare the people of North Qi

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.980
cause trouble on my territory!

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.180
Your Highness,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.300
it happened so suddenly.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.500
There must be other clues
in Qinxi Valley.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.700
Please allow us

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.900
to seal off Qinxi Valley

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.180
for investigation.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.900
Then I leave it to you.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.740
You must get

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.220
to the bottom of this.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.820
Yes.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.100
Mr. Gu,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.920
how is your injury?

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.780
It's not serious.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.980
Miss Song has bandaged me.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.420
I'm tired.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.740
Hanmei,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.940
let them all leave.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.940
The auction banquet

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.060
is over.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.300
Goodbye, Your Highness.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.220
Chu Yu,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.340
follow me.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.580
I'll wait for you outside the door.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.620
Seeing me here,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.980
you seem quite surprised.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.940
I was just worried

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.100
that Ms. Chu would fall.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.460
Then it seems

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.380
that you must try harder

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.220
to hide your secret and expressions.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.740
Anything good happened to you?

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.580
You look so happy.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.180
I've only heard that General Wei Jun

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.100
was valiant

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.860
and rare in the world.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.340
But just now,

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.540
Young Marquis Wei's moves

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.500
were also good.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.420
I don't think he'd be inferior

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.460
to General Wei Jun.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.780
Young Marquis Wei

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.420
is indeed a fine young man.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.180
The only drawback is

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.820
that he has to go to the battlefield.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.700
Otherwise, he'd be a good choice.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.780
Naturally.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.200
Chu Jin,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.340
when you choose a husband,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.380
you must be careful.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.220
A man like Young Master Sun

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.000
is definitely not someone to rely on.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.140
The eyes of Ms. Chu Jin

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.260
look very bright to me.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.300
Why does she need your reminder?

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.860
You're not even worthy

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.420
to marry into the Wei family.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.660
Ms. Chu Jin,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.060
with so many things happening

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.200
at the auction banquet today,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.080
were you scared?

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.380
Thank you for your concern.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.020
(Qinxi Valley)

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.900
You promised me something

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.980
at the banquet just now.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.340
Is it still valid?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.540
I don't know if you like

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.780
to play pitch-pot.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.900
I learned it with my brother
when I was young,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.700
but I haven't played for a long time,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.760
and I'm quite rusty now.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.660
I can teach you.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.100
I'm very good at this.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.180
One day,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.660
I can invite some friends,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.040
and we can go to the suburbs

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.640
to play pitch-pot and enjoy the spring.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.500
What do you think?

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.260
Thank you for your kind invitation.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.060
If I have time,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.380
I'd like to see

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.220
your skills.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.980
In a few days,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.420
I'll send an invitation to your home.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.660
Then it's settled.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.140
When I choose a good day,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.460
I'll come to pick you up.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.900
Sure.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.380
Then I'll take my leave now.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.060
Goodbye.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.360
Your Highness, please forgive me.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.340
I didn't tell you

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.420
my plan for today in advance

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.420
because I didn't have solid evidence.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.180
When you came to me that day,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.020
I knew you had something on your mind.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.340
Though I didn't know what it was,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.820
I was willing

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.940
to trust you.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.460
Today, I helped you again.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.620
Will you trust me

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.420
in the future?

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.860
If there is a next time,

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.040
there is no need
to go through so much trouble.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.260
As the Eldest Princess of Great Sui,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.700
I may be domineering,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.820
but I'm also magnanimous.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.060
I won't lose the big picture
over small things.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.820
So, you can directly tell me

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.980
in the future.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.540
(Qinxi Valley)

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.620
Your Lordship,

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.720
get into the carriage.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.090
I'll wait here.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.020
I'm worried

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.140
that you'll catch a cold

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.700
waiting here for Ms. Chu.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.140
What if you got a headache or fever?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.020
If you keep talking,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.300
I'll have a headache right now.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.700
Your Lordship,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.940
have you truly thought it through

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.300
about your feelings for Ms. Chu?

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.980
I have.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.460
Ms. Chu is here.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.860
I can see her.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.460
Does the wound still hurt?

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.660
It's fine.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.880
You must've been tired.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.160
I've come to take you home.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.820
Thank you, Young Marquis Wei.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.020
(Yao Mansion)

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.460
How useless.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.940
We had a perfect trap.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.740
How could he escape?

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.700
Young Marquis Wei

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.860
has never been here before,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.080
nor does he know the layout.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.300
Yet he escaped so quickly.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.060
Does he have

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.780
some supernatural ability?

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.020
Nonsense.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.580
Someone must've helped him.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.210
Go.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.100
Bring everyone

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.040
who was on duty today.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.260
I want to ask them in detail.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.860
Yes.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.700
Hurry up.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.300
Also,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.460
about that assassin
in Qinxi Valley today,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.020
I had him take the opportunity

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.960
to gather intelligence.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.620
Instead, he directly attacked Chu Yu.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.020
Has he gone mad?

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.300
But he's already dead.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.500
Presumably, he didn't reveal

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.440
any other information.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.300
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.220
Father.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.300
I'm back.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.940
Where is Gu Chusheng?

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.140
Why didn't he come back with you?

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.460
He's gone to handle a case.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.120
Do you need him for something?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.620
I'll tell him when he returns.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.900
You should rest early.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.060
I heard he was injured today.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.540
What exactly happened?

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.060
He was injured today

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.340
while saving me.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.740
At this point,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.980
you're still defending him?

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.820
Do you really think I don't know

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.700
what happened today?

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.180
Nowadays,

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.900
he still has an ambiguous relationship

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.900
with Ms. Chu.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.820
What does he

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.060
take our family for?

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.980
Father,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.500
Chu Yu is a strange woman

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.620
who will stop at nothing

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.300
to achieve her goals.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.700
I can't compete with her,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.180
nor can I outwit her.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.180
How could Gu, who is so upright,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.180
be a match for her?

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.220
I've seen

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.440
what kind of woman she is.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.140
You're my daughter.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.620
We won't be pushed around

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.980
by a woman.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.860
Don't worry.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.740
Since she bullied you

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.620
like this today,

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.860
I will definitely not

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.340
let her go.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.800
Your Highness, you must've been tired.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.930
I'll take my leave now.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.060
Why the rush?

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.460
Grant Hanmei

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.220
a seat.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.060
Since such a thing happened

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.380
in my place today,

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.180
I naturally need

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.700
to search thoroughly.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.460
Indeed,

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.260
there are two culprits.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.180
You secretly colluded

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.820
with the North Qi people.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.240
You passed intelligence

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.780
to the North Qi people.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.420
Also...

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.540
Hanmei,

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.860
what do you think I should do with them?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.620
I'm innocent.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.900
I did meet the North Qi people

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.760
during my travels,

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.500
but I certainly didn't commit treason.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.100
Of course, I know.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.500
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.620
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.700
Kill them.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.020
Kill them right here.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.700
I'm innocent.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.540
I'm innocent!

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.980
What fun is there in just killing them?

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.060
Watching the expressions

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.260
on the faces of the dying

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.740
is the most entertaining.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.380
Hanmei,

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.660
do you understand?

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.660
The people of Great Sui and North Qi

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.360
have suffered from the chaos of war.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.390
You gave me

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.580
a new name and a new life.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.080
How could I have any ulterior motives?

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.060
Keep running.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.580
Why do you stop now?

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.820
Take out your money pouch.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.300
We won't make it hard for you.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.740
Take it out.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:14.900
Let's go.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.470
Come with me.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.100
From now on,

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.040
no one will dare to bully you like this.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.000
If you don't believe me,

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.500
then kill me

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.000
to prove my innocence.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.900
I don't want to accuse you of anything.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.420
I just don't like being deceived.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.820
Otherwise, your end

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.260
will be the same as these two.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.660
Do you understand?

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.420
If I really want to win your favor,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.980
wouldn't it be better to say

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.920
that I'm from Great Sui?

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.180
Although I'm from North Qi,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.980
I've never deceived you.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.700
Your Highness,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.660
you have always known

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.540
my heart.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.340
I have never known

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.180
your heart.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.060
How could I know?

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.620
But Hanmei,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.620
everyone in the world can betray me,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.380
but you must not.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.860
Do you understand?

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:51.980
I won't.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.020
Never.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.020
(Joy)

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.180
This is our wedding night.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.100
Where are you going?

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940
We are both tired today.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.660
Let's rest early.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.500
Gu,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.380
I know

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.540
today's events have exhausted you.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.620
But we are already married.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.440
In the future,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.540
we still have plenty of time

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.580
to get to know each other.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.740
I have waited

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.500
for a devoted husband,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.620
so I won't give up easily.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.020
Gu,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.300
since you

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.060
have chosen to be my husband,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.500
can we forget

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.100
about the past?

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.700
If you could forget,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.260
you wouldn't have been so determined
to marry me,

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.060
would you?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.220
Give me some time.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.940
Gu Chusheng.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.220
Answer me.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.100
Have you ever considered me

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.420
as your wife?

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.220
What have I done wrong

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.140
to let you treat me like this?

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.100
You still love Chu Yu, right?

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.380
Answer me.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.260
Answer me!

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.220
Gu Chusheng, answer me!

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.340
Tell me. Do you still love her?

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.940
Do you still love her?

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.810
Answer me!

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.780
So what if I love her?

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.380
What do you take me for?

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.300
I can endure

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.700
the loneliness of not sharing a bed.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.300
I can also help you

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.300
cover up in front of my father.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.180
I've done so much for you,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.020
and you just can't see it, can you?

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.020
Do you know how sinister

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.940
she is?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.250
She is so ruthless,

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.220
and you still love her?

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.180
You have never let go of her.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.500
So, why did you marry me?

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.340
Why do you have to torture me like this?

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.500
Don't you know

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.420
why I married you?

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.080
Take a look.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.470
The Four Treasures of the Study.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.540
Has Miss Song bandaged you?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.940
Should we go to the clinic?

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.260
It's all bandaged up.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.100
Let me show you.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.940
I...

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.040
No matter what happens in the future,

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.460
don't hurt yourself.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.520
It really doesn't hurt.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.660
I'm afraid you're in pain.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.540
Today...

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.920
What happened today

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.060
is indeed a bit strange.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:12.820
I originally planned

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.940
to use the excuse of an assassin

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.020
to stall Yao Yong,

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.860
but unexpectedly,

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.260
there really was an assassin.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.580
We put on a show,

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.300
and they took it seriously.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.940
None of them is easy to deal with.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.100
Yao Yong

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.460
is indeed very cunning.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.540
Yes.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.260
You came late today,

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.300
and I was worried

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.420
that you might be trapped.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.540
I ran into Jue at Yao Mansion.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.460
Jue?

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.780
It's me.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.820
Chase!

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.060
Get inside.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.840
Yun, why are you here?

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.300
Yao Yong might've committed treason.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.780
I came to investigate this.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.580
Jue,

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.680
I need a favor from you.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.840
This is the map of Yao Yong's study.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.980
The secret room marked here

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.540
may contain evidence

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.080
of Yao Yong's collusion with North Qi.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.540
Feng's death

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.160
is also related to him.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.540
Are you willing

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.580
to avenge Feng personally?

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.300
There is a window
behind the four-poster bed,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.900
leading to the parapet of the backyard.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.040
You can leave through there.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.340
As for what you want,

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.340
I will do my best.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.340
Hurry up and leave.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.780
Yao Yong is not a good person.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.020
If he finds out

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.900
that it was Jue who helped you escape,

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.460
he won't let her go.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.320
We need to come up with a plan asap

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.160
to save Jue.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.950
I was thinking the same thing.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.220
Today, I discovered

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.470
that he was hiding weapons at home.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.580
He's planning a rebellion?

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.220
These weapons will definitely be moved.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.980
But this trip today

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.700
was not entirely in vain.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.240
As a high-ranking official

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.540
in the court,

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:42.980
how can Yao Yong do

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.340
such outrageous things?

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.660
How greedy

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.580
can a person be

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.220
to never be satisfied?

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.120
Great Sui and North Qi
have been at war for years,

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.700
and the commoners are suffering.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.020
As for us who are fighting in the war,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.960
we only hope for peace in the world.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.860
How can there be people like him

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.260
who don't care about others' lives?

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.620
Why should he be able to live well?

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:04.740
Why should he

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.940
keep getting promoted?

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.340
It's so unfair.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.380
Your Lordship, My Lady,

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.420
we're home.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.180
It's been quite a tiring day.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.560
You should rest early.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.940
What's wrong with Ms. Chu?

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.700
She looks so dispirited.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:36.800
Did you confess to her?

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:38.900
Stop your nonsense.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:23.620
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.300
Among thousands of flowers,

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.380
the one I want

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.860
is just this one.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.940
I know I can't,

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.140
but if it's you,

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.020
I want to try once.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.900
Linyang.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.940
Jin has told me everything that happened

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.840
at the auction banquet.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.220
If I had known,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.560
I should have been there.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.420
Linyang,

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.340
why are you blaming yourself?

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.950
Since you had a plan,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.540
why didn't you tell me?

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.860
It's confidential.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.540
To avoid alarming anyone,

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.800
I even

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.730
kept the Eldest Princess

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.700
in the dark.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.420
Besides,

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.960
if I had gone back for no reason,

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.230
Yao Yong

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.680
would've become suspicious.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.300
If you had told me even a little,

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.210
I would definitely have been there.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.260
Perhaps,

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.160
you wouldn't have been hurt.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:23.900
I kept it from you

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.240
to avoid implicating you

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.220
if the plan failed.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.020
Yu,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.220
I had no choice but to agree

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.020
to you marrying Wei Jun.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.440
Now, I really don't want you

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.700
to risk your life

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.310
for the investigation.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.380
Linyang,

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.620
it's about Father.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.320
I can't think about anything else.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.140
Nothing is more important to me

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.780
than finding out the truth

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.180
about Father's death.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.660
I know you hate the taste
of the medicine,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.160
so I brought this topical medicine.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.220
(As your eldest brother,)

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.620
(I'm not strong enough,)

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.100
(so you have to risk your life.)

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.580
Don't you know

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.000
what kind of person your father is?

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.180
He gave me two choices:

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.460
One was the path to success,

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.340
which was to marry you;

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.780
the other

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.220
was the path to death.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.860
If it were you, what would you choose?

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.300
I thought

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.980
about death,

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.260
but what about the grievances

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.300
of my parents

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.820
and the dozens of lives in my family?

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.580
I have to clear their names;

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.860
I have to overturn the case.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.140
Clear their names?

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.860
Overturn the case?

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.780
I don't know anything

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.140
about what you're saying.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.180
All I know is that I love you.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.180
What do you see in me,

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.500
such an unworthy man?

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.480
Chu Yu waited for me for five years,

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.380
and I could just marry you.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.280
I'm following every step

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.880
that your father instructed me to take.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.180
What more do you want from me?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.500
To be good to you?

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.000
To fall in love with you?

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.020
Gu,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.220
I can learn

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.700
those poems and songs

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.140
that I don't like for you.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.620
I can even learn from Chu Yu

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.840
to be an eccentric

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.220
and free-spirited woman for you.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.220
Don't leave me, okay?

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.440
We can't go back to the beginning,

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.460
nor can we fulfill our own wishes.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.300
We have to swallow the bitter fruit

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.540
that we ourselves have sown.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.420
You are like this,

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.620
and so am I.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.300
But I am your wife.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:12.500
Rest early.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.060
Wei Yun,

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.060
why are you here?

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.580
Just passing by.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.300
The Spring Breeze House is nearby.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.940
Why come here to drink?

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.080
What's so good
about the Spring Breeze House?

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.300
It's compartmentalized.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.860
Even for a simple meal

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.700
or drink,

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.380
one has to put on airs
to seem dignified.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.660
Look.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.900
How nice it is here.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.460
People coming and going,

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.940
with hearts close to hearts.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.740
I like it

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.900
here.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.820
Ever since we came back
from Qinxi Valley,

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.000
you've been in a bad mood.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.240
Is it because of Yao Yong?

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.740
Guess

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:47.900
why I'm unhappy

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.340
because of Yao Yong.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.300
Is it because of your father?

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.100
General Chu spent his whole life
in the military,

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.500
devoting everything to Great Sui

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.060
and its people,

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.740
yet in the end,

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.940
he died on the battlefield.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.180
Yet a rat like Yao Yong,

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.040
who betrays Great Sui
and sells out his country,

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.660
can still live a good life.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.140
You feel wronged,

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.020
don't you?

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.700
Why should my father

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.980
and those soldiers,

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.620
who fought so hard for Great Sui,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.620
end up dead?

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.980
Why should a traitor

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.460
like Yao Yong

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.180
enjoy high positions

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.460
and rich rewards?

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.520
You and I will remember

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.380
their sacrifices,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.380
and so will the people of Great Sui.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.540
Our descendants will never forget.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.380
Their sacrifices

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.140
will not be in vain.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.080
We've been investigating all the way

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.460
from the Arsenal Bureau to Wei Tongfeng,

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.060
and now to Yao Yong.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.980
How hard it's been.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.580
We encountered dangers time and again.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.540
Now, we've discovered

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.020
that he's suspicious,

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.260
but we can't just kill him

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.580
with our own hands.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.460
What a pity.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.500
Do you regret it?

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.900
Regret?

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:50.820
No.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.840
I've never regretted it.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.540
I will continue the investigation.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.260
No matter how many of them there are,

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.860
or how powerful

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.420
the forces behind them are,

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.500
I will capture them with my own hands.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.300
I will make them kneel before the graves

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.700
of our fathers and brothers

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.240
and those soldiers who died in battle,

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.900
and let them repent.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.020
I will make them kneel forever.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.700
I will do

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.340
what I say.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.070
No matter how hard this matter is,

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.080
I am willing to do it with you.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.660
Good.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.140
- It's raining.
- It's pouring.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.180
Hurry up.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.620
Wei Yun, come and see.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.660
It's raining.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.580
Landlady.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.960
Two more jugs of Rose Dew.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.060
Coming.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.620
More wine?

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.460
I'm not drinking by myself.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.140
I'm drinking with my father.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.020
Wait a moment, here.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.220
This jug

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.340
is for my father

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.260
and those brave soldiers.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.500
I'll also toast to my parents,

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.180
my brothers,

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.740
and the soldiers

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.180
who died in Baidi Valley.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.220
Also,

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.420
to those who sacrificed
their lives for justice

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.380
and their families.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.500
To what they did for the war...

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.860
No.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.860
To everything they did

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.700
for peace.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.140
Stop drinking.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.200
Or you won't be able to go home.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.140
Don't look down on me.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.340
I can never get drunk.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.460
You can never get drunk,

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.740
huh?
