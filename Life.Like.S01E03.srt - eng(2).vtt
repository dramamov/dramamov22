Hurry!

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.000
Take them away.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.080
Get these weapons

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080
moved back.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.360
That Zhou Musheng just had

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.400
to be in the way.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.960
Hang in there!

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.690
I'll get you to the hospital right now.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.920
Rose…

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.760
Rose…

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.280
Seriously? At a time like this?

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.880
I'll get you to the hospital first
and then pick her up.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.760
Oh,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.560
Ms. Rose.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.800
Musheng's hurt.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.880
He sent me to pick you up.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040
He's hurt?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.960
How bad is it?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.320
He was half-conscious,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.160
and still

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520
mumbling your name.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.040
He's got it bad.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.360
Well,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.800
if you're free,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.280
shall we?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.600
Oh, yes.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.440
Let's go.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.640
(I might as well see how bad it is.)

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.440
He's in there.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.360
Go on in.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.200
I'll check with the doctor.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.080
All right.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.120
Oh, my goodness!

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.920
You scared me!

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.600
I'm sorry.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800
I'm so sorry, Musheng.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.840
Who did this to you?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.880
Let me see.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.600
(I shot him in the chest.)

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.680
(How did he…)

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.590
What's got you distracted?

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.200
That hurt?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.000
I'm not gasping in pain,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
so why are you?

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.920
I'm hurting for you.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.400
Oh, dear.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.360
I see I'm interrupting a moment.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.960
Liu.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.000
Musheng,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.600
you've got some luck, huh?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.360
The doctor just told me.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.320
That bullet

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.480
hit the pocket watch

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.640
you were wearing, dead center.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.280
The shooter sure had good aim.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.680
Look at this. It's dented right in.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.990
It went through too.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.760
The doctor said

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.480
the watch saved your life,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.520
but the bullet

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.480
still did a lot of internal damage.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.240
You need to get some good rest.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.640
I'll get going then.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.820
Call me if you need anything.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040
You two take it easy.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.200
Don't get carried away
like you're at home.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.280
Watch yourselves.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.120
I'll wash my hands.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.360
I'll get in bed.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.720
(That scoundrel.)

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.720
(Quite the grip he had.)

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.560
Boss.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
How's Musheng?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.760
He's a tough kid.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.200
Liu said

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.920
the bullet hit his pocket watch.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.240
He'll live.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.480
How did Cao Yu find out

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.480
about tonight's deal?

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.800
Someone must've leaked it.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.400
Boss.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.840
Do you think

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.400
it was one of Scarface's?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.920
That is

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.720
a possibility.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.240
But we should keep an eye out

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.640
for any moles of our own too.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.600
And

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.720
Zhou Musheng?

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.520
Treat him the same as everyone else.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.800
Understood.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.480
Captain Luo.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.200
Over here.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.040
You're a generous man.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.520
Out with it.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.080
Don't stall.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.360
I found this
digging through Cao Yu's trash.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.640
It stank.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.840
