00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.120
The silver needle and pine oil
show no discoloration.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.160
The Huoshan Dendrobium
has no sulfur toxins.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.960
- It really worked.
- Rong Zelan

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.320
resolved the crisis

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.480
of damp medicinal herbs.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.200
It worked!

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840
She really did it!

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.800
Hurry, get the ingredients
and prepare the medicine.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.360
Deliver it to Consort Li.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.680
We have no time to waste.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.760
That's wonderful.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.840
Exactly.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.800
That's great.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.040
Feng Yin,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.960
you framed your colleague
out of jealousy

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.880
and damaged the herbs.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
As a medical attendant,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.640
you disregard

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.560
the benevolence of a healer

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.040
and violated the palace regulations.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.720
Do you admit your guilt?

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.760
I do.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.020
Six months' salary deducted

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.360
and three days of confinement.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.720
If you offend again,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810
you'll be immediately expelled.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840
I accept the punishment.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.760
I keep my word.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.240
Starting today,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.320
Rong Zelan

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.360
is promoted to
second-class medical attendant.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.560
She's really promoted!

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.440
- Thank you, Minister Wu.
- That's great!

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.600
Uncle.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.800
Useless!

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.480
Have you realized your mistake?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.640
Yes, Uncle.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.440
I've realized my mistake.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.760
I shouldn't have underestimated her.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.600
The medicinal herbs were damaged,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.360
and you were punished.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.520
What is her background?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.000
She is nothing but the lowly daughter
of a demoted medical officer.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.000
However, you were forced
to kneel and beg for mercy.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.560
Isn't that shameful?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.400
In the Imperial Medical Bureau,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.160
you either step on
others' backs to climb up

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.160
or wait to be crushed into mud.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.320
You must earn

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.800
our family's honor back.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.120
Do you know what to do?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.040
I do.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.840
Remember,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.920
you must secure the position

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.240
of first-class medical attendant.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.400
Rong Zelan.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.320
She'll become
a stumbling block in your path.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.280
You must get rid of her.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.600
Make it clean.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.240
Do not get our family into trouble.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.600
If you can't even deal with

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.480
a minor medical attendant,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.240
you'll be too incompetent

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.800
to stay in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.040
Go home and get married instead.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.360
Uncle, rest assured.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.280
I'll definitely use her lowly life

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200
to secure our power

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.120
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.640
Have you heard that

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.600
the new officer
is a prestigious family's heir?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.160
It's Officer Song, isn't it?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.720
I've never seen him

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.920
diagnose a patient.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.520
He wanders around the corridor all day.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.440
What kind of a physician is that?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.140
I heard

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.680
he has connections in the palace.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.480
How could such a worthless fool

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800
wear the physician's robe?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.200
Exactly.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.800
Attendant Rong.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.960
What's the matter, Lord Song?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.480
Congratulations on

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.640
your promotion.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.320
Your meticulous calculations

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.200
have really intrigued me.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.000
At first,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.880
I thought you were up to no good.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.200
However, based on
my observations these days,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.600
I don't think you have ill intentions.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.520
I can't help but wonder

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.960
why you're so eager to be promoted.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.280
Now that you know I'm not a bad person,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.440
why ask further?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.440
However, Lord Song,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.240
you don't know medicine

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.600
but excel in martial arts.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.440
You're unaware of Licorice,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.200
yet you frequently visit the Case Room.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.160
Even Minister Wu would show respect

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.560
when he meets you.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.680
I can't help

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.720
but wonder why.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.560
Don't be nervous, Attendant Rong.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.440
You resolved a crisis

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.520
and saved the lives

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.680
of everyone
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.200
You don't seem to be a bad person.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.880
You saved me in the bathhouse

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.160
and lent me a helping hand
in the herb crisis.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.720
I'll keep that in mind.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.800
Now that you know
I harbor no ill intentions,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.720
I kindly ask you not to go further.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.000
If you continue to push me,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.840
I will take action to fight back.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.920
Don't be so nervous.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.520
I'm just curious.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.520
What's so special about the position of

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.000
first-class medical attendant

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.160
that you'd take such a risk?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920
My Lord, please

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.440
put away your curiosity.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.040
If nothing else,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680
I'll take my leave.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.280
Well, Rong Zelan,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.120
let's wait and see.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.920
(I haven't eaten all day.)

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.880
(So hungry.)

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.560
(I wonder if there's any food)

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.960
(in the Imperial Kitchen.)

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.480
Who? Who's there?

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.820
(Imperial Kitchen)

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.600
(Coming to
the Imperial Kitchen this late,)

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.480
(is the person also hungry?)

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.780
(Imperial Kitchen)

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.640
(Could it be a palace maid)

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.560
(sneaking in to steal food?)

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.580
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.160
Have you heard?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.880
Her Highness went missing last night

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.040
and was found in the Imperial Kitchen

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.600
devouring raw meat

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.720
and even gulping down fresh blood!

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.480
That's terrifying!

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.320
And then?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.680
Later, after she was sent back,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.200
she got even worse

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.720
and acted like she was crazy,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.360
shouting that she was hungry

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.760
and eating whatever she saw!

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.840
Paper, hair,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.800
candle...

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.200
She ate whatever she could get

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.720
without any hesitation,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.840
and no one could stop it!

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.320
Oh my goodness.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.720
I heard that she's been

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.840
afraid of drinking bitter medicine
since childhood.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.840
She keeps crying when taking medicine.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.560
The second-class attendant
who prepared medicine for her

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.440
was severely punished by Her Grace.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.840
Now all the second-class
medical attendants

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.530
are avoiding this task.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.840
It's more than just punishment.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.060
Last month,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.840
second-class attendant
who prepared medicine for her

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.780
got 20 strokes from Her Grace

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.870
and was thrown out of the palace
covered in blood.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.360
She said that no matter

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.040
who prepares the medicine this time,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.560
if Her Highness refuses to take it,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.000
she'll be beaten to death!

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.840
Luckily, we're not
second-class attendants and don't

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.760
need to prepare medicine.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.600
That's right.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.960
In my opinion,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.680
all second-class medical attendants

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.560
will lose their lives
because of Her Highness.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.000
Which second-class attendant
can take on this task?

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.480
Her Grace is urging us.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.440
We have no time left!

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.480
(Rong Zelan,)

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.440
(you asked for this.)

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.320
(There's no way
you can escape this time.)

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.320
Miss,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.200
Attendant Rong
is exceptionally meticulous

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.720
in her work.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.880
Why don't you let her take on the task

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880
of preparing medicine?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.320
- Oh, no!
- Attendant Rong,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.360
take the prescription.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.700
(Prescription)

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.720
(Feng Yin,)

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.520
(no matter what tricks you play,)

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.600
(you won't stop me from becoming
a first-class medical attendant.)

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.140
(Princess Jinyi, Consort Li)

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.080
Jinyi, my sweetheart.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.800
Come on.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.440
Be a good girl.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.400
Your Highness, please take the medicine.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.560
Jinyi, come on,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.920
take the medicine, and I'll

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.760
give you the shadow puppet
you've always wanted,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.600
okay?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.520
Come on.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.800
I don't want to!

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.760
The medicine is too bitter!

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.600
I don't want to drink it!

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.160
I don't want to!

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.760
What is wrong with you all?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.080
Can't you even get the princess
to take her medicine?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.240
You've been well fed and paid.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.400
Is disappointing me
all you are capable of?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.600
Your Grace, forgive me.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.760
I've repeatedly told
the Imperial Medical Bureau

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.080
to make sure the medicine is not bitter!

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.000
Why is the medicine
still too bitter to drink?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.320
Have you ever taken my words seriously?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.720
Do you think I am easy to fool?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.800
Your Grace, forgive me.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.480
Please give me another chance.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.760
I've given the Imperial Medical Bureau
too many chances.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.440
Someone, drag out the attendant
who prepared the medicine

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.560
and beat her to death!

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.270
Your Grace,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.800
please give me another chance!

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.920
I'll definitely prepare something
Her Highness will drink.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.800
Why should I believe you?

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.360
Your Grace,

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.430
half a month ago,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.600
when I was reading the classics
in the Imperial Pharmacy,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.840
I discovered a method
to help children take medicine

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.080
in the historical records
of the previous dynasty.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.440
I can't remember it clearly.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.320
I humbly request Your Grace
to allow me to search for it.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.960
If it doesn't work,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.560
I'll accept any punishment.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.240
Okay, if she refuses
to take the medicine,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.240
I'll cut out your tongue!

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.720
Thank you, Your Grace.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.760
I will not let you down.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.400
It's alright.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.000
Her Highness's illness is not ordinary.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.680
She needs to take medicine,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.480
but all medicine is bitter.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.280
I got it.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.040
Have you heard?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.760
Rong Zelan was almost dragged away
and beaten to death!

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.720
How is Zelan?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.320
Is she okay?

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.480
Zelan!

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.680
Are you okay?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.840
Did you get hurt?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.000
(Consort Li's got a fierce temper.)

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.360
(How could she go easy on her?)

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.360
Attendant Rong,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.720
why are you staring at me?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.320
Feng Yin,

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.880
stop pretending to be confused.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.480
I know exactly

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.240
what you're up to.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.370
Attendant Rong, what do you mean?

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.920
I really don't understand.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.800
What did you do?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.400
Attendant Feng, don't get me wrong.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.680
I just saw some dust

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.600
and patted it off for you.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.480
They all saw it.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.800
It seems I got you wrong.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.360
Attendant Feng, why do you look so pale?

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.640
Are you ill?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.320
Maybe I can tell

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.200
Minister Wu you need a day off.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.160
No need.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.080
Yin, are you alright?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.660
(Two Days Later)

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.400
Attendant Feng,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.040
I heard Rong Zelan went to
deliver medicine to Her Highness again.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.320
Her Grace was furious last time.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.920
I'm sure she'll be punished.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.400
I wonder

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.360
if she can survive.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.520
(I had secretly added Coptis
to the medicine.)

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.880
(There's no way)

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.440
(she can get lucky.)

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.600
Of course, I can survive.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.960
Didn't Her Highness
give you a hard time?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.560
Why would she?

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.000
Sort these herbs for me.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.840
(It's impossible.)

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.560
(She must've played)

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.760
(some nasty tricks.)

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.880
(I must expose her!)
