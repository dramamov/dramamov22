00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.770
You just wait outside.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.000
The Chief already said

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.060
I should watch how you squeeze water.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.150
Squat down.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.660
That's really something.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.240
I mean,

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.430
do you even know all their names?

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.190
Half-known, half-unknown—
they're all friends.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.080
If word gets out,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.910
you must have quite the reputation.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.440
Right?

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.630
Tomorrow, there might be more people.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.430
I hope it won't affect your work.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.360
This will spread for sure.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.200
I just wonder what kind of story

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.320
will reach

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.990
Little Erhei's ears.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.550
Let it be.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.870
So you genuinely don't know

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.470
why we brought you in, right?

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.880
I really don't know.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.270
You beat up my apprentice.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.840
That kid's your apprentice?

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.150
He's really a cop?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.150
He doesn't look like one.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.840
He's dumb as a cucumber.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.200
So what do you suggest we do?

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.350
I understand.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.960
Get out of here!

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.390
Is this funny?

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.200
This is the police station!

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.360
Get lost!

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.710
Boss, well...

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.520
Let's go, go.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.320
Let's go.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.300
Hurry up and go.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.000
Let's go, let's go.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.460
Keep up. Let's go outside.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.320
We're even now, right, Ran?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.260
You just yelled at them

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.480
to send your men away,

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.810
and that's the end of it?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.980
How about this?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.930
I'll cover your apprentice's lost wages

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.080
and his medical bills.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.280
Just name your price.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.750
Fine.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.680
Alright.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.400
Did I say you could leave?

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840
Didn't I tell you?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.960
The first thing is settled,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.960
but there's more.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.190
There's more?

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.320
Think about what else you've done.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.960
I've got a lot of things on my plate.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.890
Then we'll discuss them one by one.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.610
Many people are waiting to talk to you.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.510
Really?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.680
So many people care about me?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.720
Of course.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.200
We have narcotics officers

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.860
and criminal investigators.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.910
Which department do you prefer?

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.150
Enough, stop testing me,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.720
Ran.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.790
If there really were
so many big shots involved,

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.790
would you be the one questioning me?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.630
I'm testing you?

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.620
Aren't you testing me

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.440
by asking why you were brought in?

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.500
Otherwise, you'd have left already.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.930
Alright, I'm leaving.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.270
Fine, you can go.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.600
Proving your innocence

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.750
is entirely up to you anyway.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.390
Hold on, what exactly is this about?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.530
Have a couple more beers

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.670
and think it over?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.390
Wouldn't it be better

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.520
to go out for a drink?

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:14.640
Fair enough.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240
Have some drinks,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.270
grope a few girls,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.720
and trash a karaoke.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.030
I paid for the damages after that.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.910
I was unlucky that night.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.550
They found a girl for me,

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.550
but she looked just like my mother.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.750
I slapped her,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.080
then the manager got mad at me.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.550
After destroying the karaoke,
did that calm you?

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.720
Where did you go next?

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.000
How would I remember?

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.750
Wherever there were pretty girls,
I went there.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.150
Who told you to come here?

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:37.840
Go back!

Have you seen him since?

Who?

Liu Aijun.

Hold on.

That's ancient history.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.320
You're just like my mom.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.320
That’s ancient history, man.

Why are you pretending with me?

It's all in the past, Ran.

It's really in the past, huh?

For me, that chapter is over.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.360
You never saw him again?

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.870
How's he doing,

Liu Aijun?

Does he have any family left?

Look, why are you asking me all this?

He signed the paperwork to fire you.

Could you just swallow that humiliation?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.060
Do you think he's worth it?

what you're talking about.

Let me remind you,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.520
it's serious.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.580
Let me tell you something.

I didn't say it was a woman.

You just said it.

Does Liu Ke sound like a man's name?

Why couldn't it be a man's name?

On May 18,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.000

Where are you going?

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.790
We can't just let him walk away like this.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.000
Look at yourself.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.920
Go home and get some rest.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.550
I'm fine.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:57.380
[Interrogation Room]

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.170
Is it funny?

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.550
Not Hong Kong style.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.310
What do you mean, Mr. Hei?

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.840
It has to be Hong Kong style.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.920
Have you watched how

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.440
they dress in Hong Kong movies?

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.200
Joey Wong,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.200
Vivian Chow,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.590
and Amy Yip.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.950
Got it.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.970
Please try this drink again, sir.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.440
This is too weak.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.400
A-add some more liquor.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.070
Mr. Hei.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.030
Sir,

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.990
what brings you here?

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.270
Cut the act.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.510
I almost forgot,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.160
we should celebrate you

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.550
for catching Crazy Monk.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.150
Let's have a drink.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.480
I don't have time for it.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.080
I need to ask you something.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.560
Good news.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.310
Please don't tell me it's good news.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.880
I must tell you,

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.290
and you must listen.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.570
Let's head out, all of you.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.060
Singing again?

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.400
I could participate in

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.880
a Karaoke competition now!

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.280
Tell me about Crazy Monk.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.800
You asked the right person.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.000
In 1979,

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.010
he threw bricks into our yard,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.210
and put my mom in the hospital.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.830
In 1981,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.920
I went to steal steel,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.290
and he reported me to the factory office.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.690
The security chased me,

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.890
I fell off the wall

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920
and broke my legs.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.680
Are you messing with me?

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.690
Then what do you want me to say?

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.850
Should I say he raped

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.270
and murdered people?

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.810
I don't know about that.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.960
Tell me about

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.810
his young girlfriend.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.420
That's actually true.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.440
I heard...

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.110
he found a young girl

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.310
to be his girlfriend.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.320
She must've been in his car.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.370
He's just showing off.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.770
He learned it all from me.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.620
What happened after that?

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.750
I don't know.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.270
You know

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.790
I don't get along with him.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.790
So there's no way I'd know details

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.920
about his business.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.000
Do you know

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.840
who his girlfriend is?

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.070
Sir, I really don't know.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.200
If I knew, wouldn't I tell you?

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.600
You...

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.000
I... I want to see him locked up too.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.610
But I can't just make things up.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.200
I've already given you a chance.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.160
Sir,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.000
the underworld

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.530
is just like kids fighting.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.400
If you lose,
you can't run to your parents,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.240
and you certainly can't tell the teacher.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.920
Don't act

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.490
all righteous with me here.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.240
What did you two fight about

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.350
before all this?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.720
Before...

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.070
Before...

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.130
I honestly forgot.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.440
But you know what?

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:47.760
When he gets out,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.100
we'll definitely keep fighting.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.400
Who is it?

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.920
Are you dumb?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.480
You... you really are a cop.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
You've got guts.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.680
We've already arrested Crazy Monk.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.270
I know.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.440
Then we'll settle the score

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.440
when he gets out, okay?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.170
So you're hoping he'll get out?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.820
I'll tell him

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.050
that you're the reason he's locked up.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.290
Are you trying to set me up?

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.090
He's not that dumb.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.400
You think he'll believe whatever you say?

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.070
Whether he believes it or not
is his business.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.530
But I'll make sure he does.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.110
Sir,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.550
all the money I have is right here.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.280
Just take it.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.120
How could I take your money?

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.480
Then how about this?

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.350
Let me off the hook this time.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.160
How?

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.000
I swear I didn't know

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.640
you were a cop that day.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640
If I had known you're a cop,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.750
would I have hit you?

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.550
This has nothing to do with that day,

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.240
and it has nothing to do with you either.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.770
But if you don't cooperate,

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.090
then it'll have something to do with you.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.400
You want me to sell out my boss, right?

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.830
I'm telling you, I can't do that.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.000
It's not selling him out.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.400
It's telling the truth.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.400
We just want to know

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.640
where Crazy Monk went

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.840
on the night of May 18.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.130
What happened?

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.830
The day he trashed the New York Karaoke,

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.220
a girl died.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.030
Zhang Dan?

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.070
Who?

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.550
I was drunk that day.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.550
I mean it.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.990
I don't really remember.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.330
Who did you just say?

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.240
Nobody.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.750
I said I was drunk that day

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.950
and I don't remember.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.200
Hey, don't do it.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.000
Wait, sir.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.310
Sir, sir.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.250
Sir, hey...

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.130
what are you doing?

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.130
Do you have a ruler?

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.040
Over there. There's one.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200
9 centimeters.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.640
What a pity.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.450
If it was one more centimeter,

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.440
you'd be charged
with obstructing official duties,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.540
and that's three years in prison.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.700
I get what you mean.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.590
You're trying
to pin something on me, right?

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.880
No, I'm helping you.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.240
I haven't had my injury checked yet.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.830
If I don't touch this wound,

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.200
it's a minor injury,

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.240
which means six months in prison minimum.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.200
Think about it. Which would you prefer?

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.860
Choose one.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.400
Sir, sir!

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:29.830
Sir!

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.540
I'm sorry.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.640
There's a knife over there.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.590
Just take it and stab me,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.120
will you?

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.330
Let's call it even.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.310
Stop hurting yourself, okay?

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.400
I really can't

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.680
betray my boss.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.830
If I talk,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.980
Crazy Monk will kill me when he's out.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.680
Don't!

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.160
I'll talk, I'll talk.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.200
He was...

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:48.790
he was messing around with a girl

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.790
in your precinct.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.080
Her name's Zhang Dan.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.880
She was pretty young,

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.110
looked like a high school student.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.570
Later, that girl ran away.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.590
Ran away?

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.480
Where did she go?

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.010
I don't know where she went.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.550
But that girl

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.750
definitely couldn't stand Crazy Monk.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.680
Crazy Monk's like a psycho!

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.200
After she left,

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.880
we all assumed

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.510
that something
must've happened to Zhang Dan.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.160
Why?

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.070
He wouldn't let anyone mention her name.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.720
If anyone mentioned Zhang Dan,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.270
he'd get mad and hit them.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.160
Where did Zhang Dan live?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.310
She probably lived

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.870
in the Nanhuaishu precinct.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.510
On May 18,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.690
the day it was raining heavily,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.670
for Zhang Dan's second aunt

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.670
to look after.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.110
Zhang Dan was still in school,

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.170
so she stayed here.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.820
I think...

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.320
she's been living here
for almost 2 years now.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.190
Do you know

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.160
where she is now?

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.450
I really don't know.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.030
What about her father, Zhang Guodong?

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.710
Around here,

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.840
they call him "Strong Zhang."

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.700
It actually means he's a laborer.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.370
He went out to do hard labor.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.440
I heard...

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.550
he either went to Shenzhen

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.590
or Hong Kong.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.560
Anyway, he left.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.840
When did he leave?

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.180
That was even earlier.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.880
How much earlier?

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.480
Auntie.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.370
Coming!

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.110
What's going on?

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.110
These two police officers

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.480
want to talk to Zhang Dan.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.150
Zhang Dan's not here,

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.550
that's why I called you over.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:29.120
Hello.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.000
Did Zhang Dan get in trouble again?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.060
-No.
-Zhang Dan...

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.890
Zhang Dan's friend did.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.920
We just want to confirm something.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.580
Is she home?

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.850
I haven't been here in a while.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.200
Let's go inside then.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.200
She seems to love studying.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.400
Yes, she does.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.590
She didn’t do well
on the college entrance exam,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.880
so she started teaching herself English,

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880
said English

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.410
is the universal language.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.550
Are you looking for something?

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.510
No.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.720
Please don't be nervous.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:33.230
Do you know

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.640
what she's doing now?

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.920
She used to

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.840
sell straw-burning
perpetual motion machines,

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.370
and artificial pearls too.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.970
Later she said it was a scam,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.330
so she stopped doing it.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:50.510
After that,

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.550
I don't know what she's been doing.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.680
How long since you last heard from her?

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.920
About a month.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.120
So you haven't been here lately?

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.280
She never reaches out to me,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.550
so I never come
unless there's something important.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.400
Do you have her dad's phone number?

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:07.960
Yes.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.560
I don't call it often.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.850
Her clothes are soaking here, unwashed.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.480
[Zhang Guodong’s phone number]

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.000
Hello?

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.760
I'm looking for Zhang Guodong.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.280
Who's calling?
(Sounds like Bingguo in Cantonese)

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.590
Not Bingguo,
I'm looking for Zhang Guodong.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.510
Hey, do you even speak Cantonese?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.840
This is Yanchuan City,

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.150
Nanhuaishu Police Station.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.800
Does anyone there

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.840
speak Mandarin?

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.190
Bro, what's wrong with you?

What do you want?

I don't know what you're talking about.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.000
It's so inappropriate!

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.370
-Yeah.
-Exatcly.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.300
No decent people would come here.

Ma'am,

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.280

Later,

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.880
I'll report this to my supervisor,

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.340
and deal with it properly.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.880

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.110
I'll stay open for a few more months.

They said the wallet was sent to Nan...

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.320
Nanhuaishu?

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:27.860
Yes.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.800
That's where Zhang Dan

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.480
lives now.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.960
My old ID card is with Zhang Dan.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.590
I remember now.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.250
I think I've seen that wallet.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.460
I'll go look for it.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.880
Thank you.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.780
How about we...

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.280
install a light

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.070
above that sign?

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.070
Let's keep the light on all the time.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.190
Okay.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.920
Let's install a big one with high wattage.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.050
How about 100 watts?

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:58.150
Let's go with 200 watts.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.680
Do it right once and for all.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.050
Sounds good.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.530
I'll leave you guys to that.

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:06.400
Officer Ran.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:11.440
Thank you for today.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.030
I should be thanking you.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.960
When you have some free time,

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.130
let's have a drink.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.740
What happened earlier was

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:22.960
a work-related business.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.020
Drinking together

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.290
is quite personal.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.640
I don't think that's necessary.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.490
Goodbye.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.960
He's really difficult to deal with.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.760
What are you looking for?

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:54.400
[Name: Zhang Guodong]

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.330
Isn't this what that old man found?

00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.440
Do you know

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.680
where that old man is?

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:12.350
Zhang Liming.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.600
Are you Zhang Liming?

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.840
Did you find this wallet?

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.070
Yes, I did.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.480
Where did you find it?

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.330
What now?

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:24.840
Did you find the owner?

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.280
Yes.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.440
The owner wants to thank you.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.150
But,

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.070
if you can't tell us exactly

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:31.400
where you found the wallet,

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.150
you won't get the money.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.950
I can tell you.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:33.510
Sure.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.110
And it's definitely accurate.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:35.640
It was...

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.760
right under that bridge over there.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.800
Right here.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:44.880
Up ahead.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:46.170
Alright, alright.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:30.970
Don't come any closer.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:08.280
I was right.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:10.360
It's a serial murder case.
