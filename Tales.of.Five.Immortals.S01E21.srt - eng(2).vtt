00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.599
I failed to save Bai Ye

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm sorry

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.159
It's not your fault

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.319
I won't let you say that

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.840
Xiaowei, don't worry

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.000
I will find the killer

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.519
and avenge Bai Ye

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.079
Okay

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.959
How did you find this place?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.879
Through Chunsheng's clues

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.959
I tracked it here

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.719
Then I discovered

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.760
Bai San Ye is a prominent tycoon

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.000
Rumors say White Immortal is a healing deity

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.079
Chunsheng used this pretense

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.400
to make him worship White Immortal

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.319
seeking immortality

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.599
Bai San Ye believes it completely

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.280
Officials and nobles flock here

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.400
On this Phantom Isle

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.840
they built Baixian Villa

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.360
This place is lawless

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.400
They trick naive girls to come here

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.840
to satisfy rich men's perversions

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.319
Everyone here

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.680
has blood on their hands

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.639
So

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.800
Zhang Hua collected

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.439
girls born at the same time

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.719
marked their names

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.240
as pawns for their immortality scheme

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.719
Bai San Ye's ambitions grow

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:45.879
He's no longer satisfied

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.639
being a den for the rich

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.840
but wants greater power

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.479
In ancient fortune-telling

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.960
a person's birth

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.520
year, month, day, hour

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.599
form Year, Month

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.400
Day and Hour Pillars

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.319
Year Pillar means ancestry

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:04.960
Month means parents

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.360
Day means oneself

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.759
Hour means descendants

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.199
Each has Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.680
Ten Heavenly Stems, Twelve Earthly Branches

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.520
Their combinations

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.319
determine one's destiny

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.759
So

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.000
Different birth charts

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.319
mean different fates

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.000
Right

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.039
Birth time and location vary

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.840
creating unique destinies

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.039
Some have Pure Elemental Destiny

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.639
These girls Bai San Ye found

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.639
must correspond to

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.919
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth elements

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.879
They're for his ritual

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.240
Most likely

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.039
Then

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.719
Does this ritual actually work?

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.840
Of course not

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.599
There are no ghosts or gods

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.639
My "talking" with the dead

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.879
is just noticing things

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.800
others overlook

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.560
In this world

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.840
too many entrust fate

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.039
to empty superstitions

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.280
Reason won't reach them

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400
they won't listen

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.120
So we use their superstitions

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.199
to communicate

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.000
But Bai San Ye's

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.959
exact plans remain unclear

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:26.920
I need more time

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.639
to investigate

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.639
Continue

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.519
Stay back!

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.319
Come closer and I'll strike

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.759
That's it

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.160
Your tears excite me, Marshal

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:01.360
Enough

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.800
What's our next move?

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.199
Here

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.000
Time's almost up

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.199
They'll come for you soon

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.680
I'll send word

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.920
Lead all the girls out

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.800
Then what?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.879
I've hidden a boat west of the island

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.240
There's a door behind the kitchen

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.240
Meet me there

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.839
Wait

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.240
Take this.

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:59.959
Why are you giving me this?

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:04.639
This hairpin...

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.399
can unlock the cell door.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.240
Now I'm returning it to you.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.600
Everything will be alright.

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.439
Promise me...

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.000
you'll come back safely.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.600
I will.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.399
Alright, they're coming.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:28.839
Wait.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.560
Your clothes.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.879
Young Marshal, it's time.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.959
We're taking the prisoner.

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.879
Move.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.120
Get in.

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:37.759
Sit down.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.399
Sit down and behave.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.079
Get inside.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:07.959
Behave yourself.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:21.879
Who told you to stand up?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.079
Sit down.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.199
Are you Xiaohua?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.879
How did you get captured?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.759
They pretended to be travelers asking for water...

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.720
then kidnapped us.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.879
Even if our parents report it, no one would believe them.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.080
Let's try together.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.399
I know how to escape.

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:52.240
Xiaohua.

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:13.320
Someone's here.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.879
You two, come here.

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:19.559
There's someone outside the villa.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.600
I saw shadows and torchlight.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.200
Young Marshal, please return to your room.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.480
We'll investigate immediately.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.240
Go.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.080
Gather everyone and patrol east.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.399
Intruders! Move!

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:31.720
Yes.

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:32.360
Yes, yes.

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:43.759
Everyone stay put.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.279
If you want to live...

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:19.679
follow me now.

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:32.799
Go now while no one's here.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.759
Go!

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.480
Move.

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:41.360
Go!

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.879
Xiaohua.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.200
Hurry!

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.279
There's a boat west of the island.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:54.360
Once aboard...

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.039
row toward the light.

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:59.200
Get them home safely.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.279
What about you?

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.799
I must find my family.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:06.879
Go quickly.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.159
Go!

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.960
Go!

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:17.159
Let's go.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:26.320
Hurry.

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.039
Faster.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.720
Quick.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:34.960
Hurry!
