How do you know I got shot

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.800
because of Du Hongyue?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.240
It's Liu.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.760
Liu told me.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.280
Why would Liu tell you that?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.960
That's what he told me.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.480
Believe it or not.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.440
Hey.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.520
Who leaked the news?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.720
Everyone's been contained?

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.760
Handed over to Man Li.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.600
Please spare us.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.520
We didn't betray you.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.200
It wasn't us!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.120
Betray the Chamber,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.600
and this is what you get.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.920
Your aim's getting better and better.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.240
No wonder you're
our Chamber's sharpshooter.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.760
Of course.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.920
Thanks to your guidance.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.560
What's it got to do with me?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.200
Bad luck.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.720
Zhou Musheng, new at the liaison office,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.680
took a bullet for me during a deal.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.520
He's still in the hospital.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.280
Zhou Musheng?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.320
From Nanpu School?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.480
Yes.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.360
I used to teach him at Nanpu School.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.240
He's your senior, in a way.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.160
I remember him.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.360
He was a star at our school.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.760
Two years above me.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.920
Since you know each other,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.600
come with me,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.000
let's visit him in the hospital.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.920
How's his injury?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.080
Is his life in danger?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.840
Why do you care so much?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.520
It's normal to care for
a fellow schoolmate.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.440
You talk too much.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.680
Look at her!

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.320
She snaps at me every time.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.600
You

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.800
don't start trouble.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.080
Don't provoke our Miss.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.280
Or you'll get scolded.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.240
Boss.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.880
You're so obviously biased!

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.800
Hey, Boss!

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.240
So, are we going to the hospital?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.200
Of course we're going.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.480
If not the hospital, where else?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.880
Quit it, or we'll end up in a ditch!

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.040
Musheng.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.240
Feeling better?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.960
Much better, sir.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.080
Senior. Do you still remember me?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.880
Man Li.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.400
You...

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.760
Man Li

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.760
is a key member of our Chamber.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.160
You're her senior.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.240
From now on,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.680
take good care of her.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.800
So, Man Li

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.840
is with you too, sir?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.920
Then from now on,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.360
please be patient with me.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.080
Hey,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.920
enough already.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.080
He's still injured.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.440
Get well soon.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.320
Thank you, Yao.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.920
Sir.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.280
The doctor said

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.960
I'm almost fully recovered.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.200
After a few days' rest at home,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.840
I can return to work.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.280
Rest a few more days at home.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.040
When you're fully recovered,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.200
come back to work.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.080
Senior.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.560
When you're recovered,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.920
I'll come visit you at home.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.120
No need, that's too much trouble.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.960
Alright.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.440
Get some rest.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.360
We'll take our leave now.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.920
Okay, sir.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.960
Musheng.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.080
Have an orange.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.280
Hey.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.240
You sly fox.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.000
Using five scoundrels as scapegoats.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.480
Killing two birds with one stone.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.440
Sometimes you need a villain's way

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.520
to beat a villain.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.800
Impressive.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.520
Thanks for the compliment.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.120
By the way,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
how's

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.960
Zhou Musheng doing?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.880
Don't worry.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.300
He's discharged and home now.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.880
Good to hear.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.400
Who is it?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.640
Came to see if you're dead yet.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.280
So vicious for someone so young.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.640
If I died,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.880
would you inherit my fortune?

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.320
How's your wound?

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.040
So impatient?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.800
I'm a decent man.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.520
Not into daytime indecency.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.920
What are you thinking about?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.360
No wonder.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.440
You got yourself shot.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.080
See?

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.560
A woman's heart is the cruelest.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.840
I'll do it myself.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.400

Look at this.

Check this spot.

Hey!

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.240
It hurts here.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.320

A bit closer.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.120
I can't take it anymore.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.000
Quick, help me out.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.160
(If I hadn't accidentally hurt you,)

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.680

Why are you here?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.360
I made chicken soup just for you.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.200
Hey, you there.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.720
Go serve the soup.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.480
Thanks for your trouble.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.560
Oh, it's

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.760
that famous little devil
from Night Shanghai.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.880
Why is she here?

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.160
I'm Musheng's woman.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.880
Musheng is sick,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.080
of course I have to take care of him.

Come.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.400
Dalang, take your medicine.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.760
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.400
Let go.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.800
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.280
Hot!

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.720
I...

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.680
I'll get a towel!

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.680
Here.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.720
I'll wipe it for you.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.240
I'll do it.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.160
I'll do it.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.640
I'll wipe it.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.090
I'll do it.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.600
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.920
Or

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.480
should I do it instead?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.680
Are you okay?

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.280
Senior.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.640
Your wound's healed,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.900
better head back to the Chamber.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.040
Take care.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.880
Why is

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.760
Rose here?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.640
That girl is amazing.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.440
When she first came to Night Shanghai,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.600
those big bosses adored her, loved her
to death, loved her like a toy motorcycle.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.120
Shut up.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.000
Go home.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.200
Senior.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.040
The way your junior calls you

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.440
feels so affectionate.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.840
Wipe it yourself.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.060
(Night Shanghai)

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:56.960
I...

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.560
I...

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.120
Hong.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.200
You're going to kill me.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.640
Why are you here, Hong?

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.600
I've got something to tell you.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.200
I heard

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.480
that batch of arms
was safely delivered to the front.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.440
Good.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.240
Shows that Cao Yu

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.160
can still handle things.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.280
Here.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.600
New mission.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:42.620
