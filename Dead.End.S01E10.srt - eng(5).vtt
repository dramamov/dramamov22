00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.289
[Episode 10]

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.950
That bastard is here.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.970
What's going on?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.480
Did 8 years inside not teach you anything,
and you're still coming for me?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.140
Is that really so surprising?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.280
Weren't you just released?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.400
Can't you lay low?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.490
Being out is pointless anyway.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.150
Do you hate me that much?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.240
Don't you know why?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.650
I can never get through

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.630
to a blockhead like you.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.150
No wonder you got locked up for brawling.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.120
Get out of my way.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.190
Enough.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.910
Did you find

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.030
the woman

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.800
who reported the case?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.960
She's on her way,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.720
along with her boss.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.329
We asked for the woman.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.170
Why is her boss coming?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.280
You think she'd come

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.030
if her boss didn't give the okay?

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.910
You know her.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.310
She's from our precinct.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.840
Who?

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.750
[Sister]

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.150

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.570
I'll go pick you up right away.

Voice Message.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.290
I'm keeping up with the times.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.430
You silly boy.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800
What kind of talk is that?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.030
We're all regulars here;

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.690
no need to be so formal with us.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.030
Yes, yes.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.960
You...

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.750
Boss.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.329
Is she from around here?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.150
Which hutong is she from?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.410
Look at Little Erhei,
acting like a damn eunuch.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.800
Officer Zhao,

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:43.870
Officer Ran,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.680
Monk.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.460
Do you remember me?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.150
I'm Lili.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.030
You two switched roles?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.520
Thanks to Lili's help,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.030
she arranged this job for me.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.810
I can't stand to watch you stoop so low.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.970
You all chat.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.730
Monk,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.430
I heard you just got released.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.630
Why don't you come work at my company?

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.430
No need.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.709
I can still afford noodles
with bean sauce.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.680
I'm not doing any errand-boy work.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.590
How dare you talk to my sister like that?

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.870
Sis,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.510
same as usual?

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.190
Latte.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.360
No sugar.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.159
No sugar.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.720
Officer Zhao,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.430
actually, you're the one

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.760
I should thank the most.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.730
You're too kind.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.520
Have you forgotten?

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.430
Back at the karaoke bar,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.510
you earnestly advised me
to change my line of work.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.370
You even came specially
to visit me in the hospital.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.400
She remembers everything.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.620
I don't even remember myself.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.720
Anyway, without you,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.250
I wouldn't be who I am today.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.240
You're giving me too much credit.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.680
It was your own hard work.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.800
I heard you came today

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.060
about that case from back then,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.490
right?

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.110
Yes,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.950
we're looking for

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.610
the girl who filed the report.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.430
I know,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.600
but

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.470
she's too scared to come.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.830
So I had her write

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.750
a formal statement

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.560
and draw

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.630
a route map.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.870
If you need

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.830
anything else,

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.470
just let me know anytime.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.870
Thank you.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.950
Actually, I heard about

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.080
this case back then.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.270
The neighbors must have done

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.310
a lot of gossiping back then, right?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.120
It's not just gossiping.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.040
I truly remember someone saying

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.200
he knew the "Hutong Killer."

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800
Who told you that?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.159
A customer.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.000
Once when he was really drunk,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.870
we were chatting

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.240
and I asked him what he did for a living.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.500
He said he was a doctor.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.560
Doctor,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.720
does that mean
if we need to see a doctor later,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.920
we can just come to you

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.630
without making an appointment?

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.670
Don't come to me.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.580
If you come to me, you're done for.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.310
Why? What kind of illness are you treating

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.360
that's so serious?

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.040
I'm treating this.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.860
Heart disease?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.390
Mental illness.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.920
Have you ever heard of

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.980
the Hutong Killer?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.950
Who?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.970
The murderer

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.970
was my patient.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.720
He came to see me

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.350
before the murder happened.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.270
After it occurred,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.830
I had a feeling

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.880
it must have been him.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.720
It's him.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.510
How can you be so sure

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.230
he was telling the truth?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.060
You actually believe him?

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.560
People go to those places

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.310
mainly to boast.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.270
Honestly, I wasn't entirely
convinced either.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.480
But the story he told

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.830
about the killer back then

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.190
was really frightening,

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.990
so it stuck with me all this time.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.440
A story about the killer?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.110
He said many killers

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.360
are psychopaths,

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.990
and it's related to
their childhood experiences.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.970
Grandpa, the fish is getting away!

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.870
It won't get far.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.460
Grandpa, does the fish feel pain?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.660
It only hurts when it's alive.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.270
When it's dead, it doesn't hurt anymore.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.320
Once it's dead,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.720
it stays put.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.120
But if it's alive,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.570
it'll always struggle and cause trouble.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.660
How do we live a life like that?

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.200
Who allowed you to leave?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.150
I'll beat you to death!

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.150
Go ahead, kill me!

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.680
Go tell your son!

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.080
Baby,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.370
I'm leaving now.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.150
Women can't be kept.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.550
It seems like Huang Hui's family

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.910
had another child too.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.360
[1994]

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.610
That's two lives.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.390
Wasn't that done by the madman?

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.870
What madman?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.000
That guy himself was as
thin

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.510
as a little chick.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.250
It was a pervert.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.630
It was done by a pervert.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.150
Why is it a pervert now?

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.470
Let's be real, any man

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.260
in the precinct

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.120

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.280
is up to no good.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.290
You're heading out this late?

[ADAN&EVE]

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.160

Yes.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.440
Give me two boxes of kidney tonics.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.300
Yes, two boxes.

How much?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.180
Twelve.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.870
Twelve, right?

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.240
Yes.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.020
Here you go.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.680
Great.

I think a Medium will fit you just fine.

Medium... Okay.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.210
This style suits you well.

pretty down too.

It was the hutong Killer.

You're the one with the slingshot,

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.240

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.590
is the only streetlight that isn't broken.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.930
He goes out running every night

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.510
and comes back very late.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.920
His grandma worries so much.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.520
And he even

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.400
asks his grandma for pocket money,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.310
who knows

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.480
what he spends it on.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.620
And also...

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.840
Also me,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.120
actually, it's nothing much...

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.000
Would you stop talking in bits and pieces?

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.790
What are you actually trying to say?

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.630
This kid...

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.190
Have you even changed your pants?

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.850
And you're sitting on the bed.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.960
He's about to
take the college entrance exam.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.010
Keep an eye on him.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.110
Make sure he doesn't get into

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:41.710
any messy business

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.310
like puppy love or anything.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.230
I'll ask his homeroom teacher later

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.090
to see if his grades have changed.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.670
If they have,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.080
then something's up.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.400
Go ahead and ask.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.280
I don't dare to.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.800
I'm afraid asking

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.199
might affect his grades.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.110
At a critical time like this,

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.710
we can't afford any mishaps.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.760
What kind of mishap could even happen?

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.620
That's why I want you to watch him.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.050
Why don't you deal with it?

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.680
Are you busy with your little career?

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.030
You're a police officer.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.320
You...

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.510
Isn't surveillance your spcialty?

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.310
If you don't watch him, who will?

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.030
I'm busy.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.910
I leave early and come back late.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.840
Is he your son or not?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.040
If he's not your son, then don't bother.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:26.190
Fine.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.480
I got it.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.710
I'll handle it, okay?

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.200
Wait for me a moment.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.150
Dongdong,

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.630
don't forget your tutoring class
this Sunday.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.070
I know.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.410
I'm leaving now.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.850
It's hot.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.550
Eat it yourself.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.110
Dad,

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:56.760
don't you know

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.290
you should buy Mom
some flowers or something?

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.660
Aren't these flowers?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Popcorn flowers.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.320
How utterly romantic.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.090
When I was dating your mom,

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.210
she really loved eating this.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.920
That was ages ago.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.070
So how do you young people

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:15.960
date nowadays?

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.000
Tell me about it.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.440
I don't know.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.030
Give me some tips.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.360
I haven't seen your teacher,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.310
Ms. Du, in a long time.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.810
How is she doing lately?

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.440
Mr. Du was my previous teacher.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.810
The cram school
has switched to Ms. Qi now.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.710
Yes, Ms. Qi.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.030
By the way,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.690
you know about Crazy Wu, right?

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.110
Is he dead, right?

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.590
Yes.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.440
Do you know how he went crazy?

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.690
He got fixated on a girl,

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.910
probably about your age.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.480
He'd spend all day reading

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.150
and reciting poetry to her.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.480
thinking it was some great romance.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.710
-Actually...
-Dad,

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:12.920
I know all about Crazy Wu.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:15.630
Those are just gossips

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.030
you heard from the old ladies
in the hutong.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.200
I've read your book.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.360
When did you

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.190
read my book?

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.360
How could you just go through

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.090
my work things without asking?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.630
Well, you used to

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.160
snoop through my stuff too.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.050
Don't read it again, understand?

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.630
I know.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.760
Turn your face toward me.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.740
What happened?

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.530
You're hurt.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.760
It's nothing.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.490
Did someone hit you?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.660
It happened a while ago.
It's mostly healed now.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.920
Who did this?

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.860
Take me to find him.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.960
Don't they know

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.480
who your father is? Huh?

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.960
How can your kids

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.160
just fight like that?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.600
How dare he hit my son!

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.280
Didn't you tell him your dad...

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:12.840
Dad,

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.190
enough!

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.720
I hate it when you pull this!

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.840
Tell me exactly what happened.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.160
I want the truth, now.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.550
I'm not a criminal.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.410
Don't use that tone with me.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.350
Come out here.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:37.840
Come out now!

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.630
Go ahead. Hit me.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.360
I don't care.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.280
Why are you so timid?

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.980
You just take a beating and accept it?

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.620
You need to fight back!

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.570
Come on,

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.000
hit me.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.960
Hit me!

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.430
Don't think of me as your father.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.510
You asked for it.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.970
Put some strength into it.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.510
See?

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.630
Try again.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.530
You can't land it, can you?

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.960
I noticed something.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.280
Why do you always blink

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.540
when you throw a punch?

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.920
It's just for a moment,

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.380
barely a tenth of a second,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.200
but it slows down your reaction.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.850
No, I don't.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.250
Come on, try again.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.670
Put some effort into it.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.280
Make it real.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.210
Come on, harder!

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.280
See?

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.960
Look—you keep blinking

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.220
when you throw a punch.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.350
How should I fix that?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:38.840
Do you want to learn?

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.410
It's actually very simple.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.840
Keep your eyes locked on your opponent's.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.100
Don't move them at all.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.330
See, you blinked again.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.680
What kind of move is that?

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.880
If a knife comes at you here,

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.680
what do you do?

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.670
No blink.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.070
My silly son,

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.710
you have to run!

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.920
Let's try again.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.360
Okay.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.030
Dad.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.710
Dad, are you okay?

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.480
I'm fine.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.400
I'm fine.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.920
My silly son.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280
I can't take it...

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.230
I can't take it.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.800
You need to get me some medicine.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800
Dad, take it easy.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.230
[Mailbox]

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.630
Rolling in this mortal world.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.880
So foolish is this deep affection.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.550
All gatherings must end someday.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.960
So live this life with a free heart.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.510
You're here.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.870
What's wrong?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.600
Why are you drinking so much?

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.120
I was waiting for you.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.280
I was busy all afternoon.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.380
I just got free now.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.380
Weren't you going abroad?

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.450
I'm not going anymore.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:42.450
What happened?

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.760
"Romance on Lushan Mountain".

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.770
"The Herdsman".

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.060
Can you believe it?

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.400
Believe what?

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.550
Love.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.440
I've only ever watched
"Garrison's Guerrillas"

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.840
and "Hunter".

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.940
He likes those too.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.030
Your lover?

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.190
Are you two having problems?

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.560
I gave him all my money

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.070
so he could go abroad.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:22.800
But

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.670
I never got him back.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.670
All I got was a letter.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.190
[To: You Jia.
Hongqi Hutong, Yanchuan City]

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.440
What did it say?

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.140
You can read it.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.000
[Jia, I'm sorry.
Some things can't be explained.]

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.090
[I can only say I'm sorry. Forever sorry.]

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.630
But why?

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.400
How would I know why?

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.800
I have no idea.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.840
Maybe I was just stupid.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.630
I was just stupid.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.230
There were signs from the beginning.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.490
I just didn't see them.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.030
He probably could have...

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.160
Don't go over there.

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.230
You might fall.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.070
You've had way too much to drink.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:06.870
I'm not drunk.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.280
Do me a favor.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.840
What favor?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.200
Help me find someone.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.840
Find him?

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.480
No.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.570
Help me find a girl.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.630
I heard

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.880
he's planning to take someone else abroad.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.080
I just want to see her.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.670
Was he with her all along?

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.070
How would I know?

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.810
Shouldn't you be
confronting him about this?

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:53.230
Look at

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.370
the sunset.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.530
How beautiful.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840
Don't you think

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:06.510
this hutong

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.000
is like a maze?

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:14.120
It feels like no matter how far you walk,
you can never find your way out.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:17.240
It really is.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.480
And it's beautiful too.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.400
Rolling

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.080
in this mortal world.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.230
So foolish is this deep affection.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:34.360
You're sitting here.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.290
We came out late.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.230
We're chatting here.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.250
What are you doing here?

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.190
I have to keep an eye on the light.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.520
If it gets broken again,

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.280
the police will blame me again.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.030
Alright.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.720
Keep a good watch on it then.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:01.880
Dad,

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:03.290
I'm going out for a run.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:04.200
Okay.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.340
I'm going to bed. Come back early.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.440
Ran,

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:30.320
that Zhou Weiping you're looking for

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:30.920
is inside.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.730
I confirmed it with
the neighborhood committee.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.000
Why is it you?

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.090
Who are you trying to

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.800
summon?

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:38.960
Ke visited me

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.000
in my dreams last night.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:44.440
She told me the first person

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.640
to enter this courtyard after midnight

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.610
would be the killer.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.110
Stop acting crazy.

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.280
This old house could go up in flames.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.280
Put those out now.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.150
Stand still.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.740
I've been waiting here every day.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.140
And you're the first person I saw.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.880
Calm down.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.400
Ran Xi.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.360
Just wait.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:11.790
You must be involved in this.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.760
Zhou Weiping.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.510
Don't run!

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.670
Stop!

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.110
Put out the fire quickly!

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:30.070
[People's Public]

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:46.630
Help!

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:48.400
Help!

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:49.700
What happened?

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:50.890
Comrade?

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:51.920
Comrade,

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.110
can you hear me?

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.400
Lin,

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.480
quick, get the first aid kit!

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:55.800
Okay.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.130
Hao, call an ambulance!

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.840
Comrade!

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.530
Comrade!

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.330
Wake up!

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.000
Comrade!

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:01.110
Can you hear me?

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.520
Kid,

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.590
don't look at this.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:05.320
Go home now.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.420
Go home now.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.360
Yes, it's at Nanhuaishu Police Station

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.400
Uncle. Uncle.
He's in a coma.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:09.800
I saw him!

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.730
I really saw him!

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.590
I saw him!

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.280
-I saw him.
-Stop messing around, kid.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.320
We're busy here right now.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.120
Go home first;

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:16.280
come back tomorrow.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.590
Uncle!

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.360
First aid kit!

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.360
-I saw it.
-Where is the first aid kit?

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.290
I really saw him!

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.670
Kid, please stop causing trouble,

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:22.110
okay?

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.670
If there's anything,
let your parents come.

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:24.870
We're busy right now.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.000
Quickly, go home!

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:27.280
The ambulance will be here soon.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:27.880
Okay.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:28.840
Lin!

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.190
Hurry up.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.890
Are you alright?

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.510
I'm fine.
