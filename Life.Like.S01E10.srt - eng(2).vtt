Boss,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.320
I'm tired. I don't want to play anymore.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.080
Win a bit of money,
and she's already trying to run.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.520
That's Man Li for you.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.680
Get some sleep.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.680
Tomorrow,
we'll have Man Li treat us to a meal.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.120
Sure, as long as you pay for it, Boss.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.400
All right.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.520
As you wish.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.640
What are you up to,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.760
skulking around at this hour?

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.440
Were you waiting for Zhou Musheng
to fall asleep so you could go out

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.760
looking for excitement?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.800
Yao,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.040
what's that supposed to mean?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.360
Don't play innocent with me.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.080
Everyone knows what you're after.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.400
I have no idea

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.160
what you're talking about.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.000
You're sticking with Zhou Musheng

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.400
because you want someone powerful
to depend on.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.320
So, be my woman instead.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320
I'm more reliable.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.720
When you run
the North City Chamber of Commerce,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.160
I'll hold onto you tight.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.960
But you don't call the shots yet.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.640
Oh, come on…

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.320
That's only

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.080
a matter of time…

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.960
Hey!

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.000
Took you long enough to get that water.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.480
You…

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.240
Yao.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.440
You even woke Yao up.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.680
I got lost on my way back.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.720
All the rooms look the same.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.720
Enough.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.080
Yao, we'll let you rest.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.040
Say good night to Yao.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.800
Good night.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.240
We're leaving, Yao.

00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.104
(Zhou Musheng,)

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.240
(don't get too full of yourself yet.)

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.480
I was only getting a glass of water.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.160
Next time, tell me
what you're going to do

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.400
and where you're going first.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.700
There are too many eyes watching you.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.660
It's not safe out there.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.600
Got it?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.640
Got it.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.480
And

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.040
stay away from Luo Zhenyao.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.520
Are you jealous?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.640
Yes.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.880
You're cute when you're jealous.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.640
I like seeing you like this.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.360
Do you like that?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.400
Zhou Musheng.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.480
You're awake.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.480
You wrinkled my dress.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760
I've got

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.480
to get back to work.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.120
If I stay any longer,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.000
I won't be able to feed myself.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.760
Can't you stay?

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.680
Stay?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.420
Are you going to take care of me, then?

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.960
I can do that.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.800
You better keep your word, then.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.800
They're probably still asleep.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.320
Tell them

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.600
I left.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.000
Be careful.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.840
You didn't buckle your shoes.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.840
Silly girl.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.640
Time to go.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.760
Mm.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.920
I'm off, then.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.720
Musheng.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.880
I've liked you since we were in school.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.960
Do you know
how many years I've liked you?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.800
Man Li,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160
you saw it yourself.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.720
I already have a girlfriend.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.920
Am I not even

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.720
as good as a performer
from Night Shanghai?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.240
You're an outstanding woman.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.400
You'll find someone better.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.680
I don't want them.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.840
You're the only one I want…

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.240
Control yourself.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.800
(That vixen.)

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.080
(She'll pay for this.)

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.840
Boss.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.440
I think Man Li's really fallen

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.200
for Zhou Musheng.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.480
But he doesn't seem to feel the same.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.680
They're both

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.480
your students.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.320
Why not help them out a little?

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.840
Who does Rose think she is?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.520
She's just a performer.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.280
Stop meddling
in other people's business.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.720
Focus on your own.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.920
Yamamoto's coming

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.920
in a few days.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.400
Oh, right.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.200
He's here

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.040
to talk about the medicine deal.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.480
I've already set everything up.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.520
