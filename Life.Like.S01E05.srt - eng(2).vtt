Hey.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.400
Stop sleeping.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.920
Get lost!

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.760
Go away.

(Song Residence)

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.720
Why are you here?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.560
I haven't heard from you
for so many days.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.920
I was worried sick.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.720
Lucky.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.990
I'm not dying that easily.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.500
It's fine as long as you're okay.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.480
Du Hongyue

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.320
is ruthless.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.840
If you're with him,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.240
you must stay safe.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.280
About the students,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640
did you find anything?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.120
There's a traitor among the students.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.080
That person secretly sold student info

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.480
to Song.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.680
Song, to please the Japanese,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.200
secretly captured a batch of students.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.120
It's been so long,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.280
I still don't know their whereabouts.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.400
Those students must be in danger.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.790
No. I must get discharged quickly.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.920
You take care of healing,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.480
I'll personally check Song Residence.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.360
I'll go then.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.560
I know best

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.120
about those students.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.920
You might

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.480
put them in danger.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.040
Take care.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.120
Boss, are you okay?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.920
Get out!

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.560
If you weren't allowed in,
don't come in.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.600
Crazy woman!

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.760
You dared to trap me!

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.040
(So much like Rose.)

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.040
Who's there?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.680
This way!

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.760
Yo.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.600
Musheng.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.080
What brings you here?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.160
I came to find Rose.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.400
Rose.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.160
Musheng is here for you.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.640
Oh, okay.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.880
Are you ready?

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.040
Almost.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.280
Come, sit.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.640
This way please.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.520
Girls always take their time.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.680
Are you ready?

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.840
Hurry up.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.960
How many times have I told you?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.840
Ready.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.320
Every time I have to remind you.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.960
My head's about to explode.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.160
Hey.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.200
Stubborn girl.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.720
Then,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.280
you two talk, I'll go first.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.480
These past few days,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800
you didn't come see me.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.520
Still angry huh?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.920
Don't you have your junior?

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.280
Why bother with me?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.190
What did it get stained with?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.320
Looks like blood.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.880
It's lipstick.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.680
When I was doing makeup,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.240
it accidentally got on me.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.120
Doesn't really look like it.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200
Look again now.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.360
Sweet and lovely.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.040
Delicate as silk.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.360
Rose.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.400
Ready?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.240
Ready.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.320
I'm coming out.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.560
Hurry up.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.680
These earrings

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.200
really suit you.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.320
Musheng.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.560
You have great taste.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.600
Master.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.640
Master.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:27.960
Master.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.920
Detective Cao.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.040
Please make sure to find the murderer.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.360
Give justice to our master.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.480
Did Mr. Song

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.240
offend anyone before he died?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.880
I know nothing

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.560
about the master's affairs outside.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.000
Who could he have offended?

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.480
Master.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.600
