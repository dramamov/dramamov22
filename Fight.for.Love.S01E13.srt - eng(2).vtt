00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.280
This really isn't appropriate.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.710
I was thoughtless.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.550
I really was.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.070
But I have a favor to ask.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.710
I can't see you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.310
without Her Highness's permission.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.710
But it's about Her Highness.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.760
I had to resort to this unwise plan.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.940
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.840
Your... Your Lordship.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.630
What are you doing here?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.310
Tell me.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.990
Why is she here?

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.910
You think some of the followers

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.800
of Her Highness

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.870
have hostile intentions?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.470
Why do you say that?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.310
The gifts I made for Her Highness

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.120
ended up in Qiju Store.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.310
I made them myself.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.470
There are many of them,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.310
yet they're unique.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.430
I don't think Her Highness

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.270
sold my gifts.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.430
So, it means

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.630
someone stole them.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.470
I see many followers here.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.470
How is one follower

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.590
selected?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.960
Talent is valued.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.590
That's all?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.280
Looks are just an added bonus.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.010
So one has to be both talented

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.880
and handsome

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.590
for Her Highness to even notice him.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.870
So, are you clear

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.030
about their backgrounds?

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.870
Is she clear?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.120
Of course.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.800
We do check their backgrounds

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120
and histories.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.190
This is strange.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.310
Don't you suspect me

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.550
of stealing them?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080
If I suspected you,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.400
I wouldn't be telling you.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.630
I'm just worried.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.150
It will be bad enough

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.030
if he just wants money.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.400
But if he wants to hurt Her Highness,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.520
things will be worse.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.680
Mrs. Wei, I didn't know

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.190
you and Hanmei were so close

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.680
that you met up at night.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.760
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.030
Yes.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.270
Tell me.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.680
I'll hear what you have to say

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.240
before I decide whether to punish you.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.150
Your Highness,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.360
Mrs. Wei...

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.190
She asked me not to tell you.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.120
Well, Your Highness.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.920
I... I made the decision alone

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.430
to meet Mr. Xue.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.120
He didn't know anything.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.240
But just now, you called me Hanmei.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.800
Shortly after you lost your husband,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.560
you took a fancy to my follower.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.600
You've changed so quickly.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.920
It's quite a surprise.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.190
What can I say?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.680
Perhaps it's my destiny

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.750
to be entangled in matters of the heart.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.720
In that case,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.120
I will give Hanmei to you.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.400
What do you say?

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.470
Please forgive me.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.430
I was just joking.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.040
Please don't take it seriously.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.800
I know I was wrong.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.120
Punish me as you wish.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.240
I don't care how you

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.560
conduct yourself out there.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.000
But this is my mansion.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.800
You can't see any of my men

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.160
without my permission.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.120
For the sake

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.240
of our past acquaintance,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.040
I'll let it slide this time.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800
But if it happens again,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.600
I won't let you off.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.590
Do you understand?

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.870
I understand.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.840
Forget it.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.270
Even if I offered

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.800
that Hanmei could go with you,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.270
he wouldn't be willing.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.320
Your Highness,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.680
Mrs. Wei was

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.920
only joking.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.830
She admires you.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.120
She wanted to be close

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.680
and give you a perfect gift,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.510
but didn't know what to say.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.270
So, she sneaked in like that.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.840
That's right.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.870
My reputation

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.740
isn't the best.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.040
But I know my limits.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.830
I came up with this foolish plan

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.000
just for a chance to get closer to you.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.360
In that case,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.870
I won't punish you.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.000
I do want a gift.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.720
What I need right now

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.070
is a perfect solution.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.240
What is that?

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.120
You can count on me to get it for you.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.920
One hundred thousand taels?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.920
Why don't you

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.120
have your followers

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.430
put their heads together?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.630
If they had any good ideas,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.240
I wouldn't be asking you.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.000
Last year, there were floods
across the nation.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.680
His Majesty allocated funds

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.710
for those victims.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.120
That has put a strain
on the national treasury.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.270
If my brother

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.750
had any other choice,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.560
he wouldn't have come to me for money.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.000
Those prominent nobles in the capital

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.480
meet and have a banquet

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.360
every few days.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.360
Such a luxurious life.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.160
But when we need money

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.240
for disaster relief,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.120
they tighten their purse strings

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560
for fear of bad impacts

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.830
on their decadent lives.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.750
They turn a blind eye
while our people suffer

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.000
and our soldiers struggle

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.960
on the borders.

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.000
My brother can't force them.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.120
But I'm not afraid to play the villain.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.270
If those nobles and officials

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.110
would donate money

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.030
to fill the treasury,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.550
all the problems

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.480
of civilians and armies

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.750
could be solved.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.910
This is exactly

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.030
what bothers Her Highness.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.120
Hanmei has thought of a way

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.840
to help me persuade those people

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.000
to contribute.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.320
All we need is the right opportunity.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.000
Mr. Xue is clever.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.510
He certainly lives up
to being your favorite.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.750
That's right.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.750
Hanmei is the most capable follower

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.840
I've ever had.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.880
Mrs. Wei,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.960
have you got an idea?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.720
Your Highness,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.080
may I use Qinxi Valley?

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.750
Qinxi Valley?

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.720
It has hills and streams.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.270
So, it's a perfect place

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.360
for nobles to gather.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.870
You want me to hold

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.720
luxurious banquets

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.360
like they do?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.720
Exactly.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.660
You'll hold banquets,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.720
lavish ones.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.870
Those people love banquets

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.960
and they're big spenders.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.000
So, we can hold an auction banquet

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.840
that will attract them.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.300
Auction banquet?

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.380
Your Highness,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.380
you can entrust me

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.260
with this banquet.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.700
I can also draft a list

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.220
of necessary guests.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.300
Your Lordship.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.460
How is Ms. Chu doing?

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.020
Was she punished?

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.180
Don't worry.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.460
They talked quite civilly.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.580
Nothing bad happened.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.100
Ms. Chu is awesome.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.420
She sneaked in there.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.180
Her Highness didn't punish her.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.300
I even heard

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.940
Her Highness might allow her

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.780
to pick from the followers.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.020
Followers?

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.020
Yes.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.820
Just now,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.180
why did you say that?

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.660
You almost got me into trouble.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.660
What if Her Highness

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.660
decided to punish us?

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.980
She has a soft spot for you.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.580
So, she wouldn't blame you.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.380
Besides,

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.420
you helped her solve an urgent problem.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.740
She will appreciate

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.740
this gift very much.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.540
(Youban Pavilion)
But...

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.700
Her Highness has many manors.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.220
Many of them are more grand

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.060
than Qinxi Valley.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.220
Mrs. Wei,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.300
why did you pick that place?

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.420
Do you think

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.700
that's inappropriate?

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.780
Not at all.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.500
Located on the outskirts,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.020
it's quite a distance.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.060
It's a remote,

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.060
but great location.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.460
Located south of Huajing City,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.540
it attracts wealth.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.700
Besides,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.900
you must keep in mind

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.820
what I told you.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.660
Make sure no one harms Her Highness.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.540
Alright. It's settled, then.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.060
By the way,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
if you need to see Her Highness again,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.220
just send word.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.260
Don't climb walls.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.500
But I have a feeling

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.180
you were using me tonight.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.260
So, now,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.100
we're even.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.500
We are.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.740
Her Highness noticed
you seemed to enjoy

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.780
the pastries on the table.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.140
She had this prepared

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.060
for you to take home.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.580
Thank you.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.540
Wen Yun?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.580
Thank you, Mr. Xue,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.700
for showing her the way.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.780
I remember the way out.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.900
Thank you, but no need to see us out.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.540
To the outside world,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.420
I favor Hanmei

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.980
(Eight Characters)
for his looks

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.420
and talent.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.100
No one could possibly know

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.660
he would have found his way
into my heart

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.740
even without the looks

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.900
or the talent.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.100
No.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.260
No.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.500
Don't.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.860
Don't be scared.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.500
I'm here.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.940
I'm here with you.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.020
Your Highness,

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.820
shall I stay with you

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.940
throughout the night?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.660
Once someone of the royal family

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.660
was involved in a fight for the throne,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.540
it would be a tragedy.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.540
Fortunately, Mr. Xue had medical skills

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.500
and healed all your scars.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.340
He healed more

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.420
than just the scars.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.740
Do you actually believe

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.020
the excuse

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.020
Mrs. Wei gave?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.100
Chu Yu never seeks me out

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.620
unless she wants something.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.580
This time, she even climbed in.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.740
And her acting was terrible.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.220
If you didn't believe her,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.780
why did you agree

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.700
to her auction banquet?

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.580
Chu Yu is intriguing.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.660
I'm also curious to see

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.420
what she's going to do.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.180
And besides,

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.540
I do need a banquet like that.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.940
We'll enjoy the show.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.140
Mrs. Wei is certainly one of a kind.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.860
I had no idea

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.660
you and she

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.180
were so close.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.900
Right under my nose,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.060
the two of you made eyes.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.260
What?

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.540
Are you

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.180
having an interest

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.020
in this special lady?

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.540
Are you angry again?

00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.780
You're free

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.940
to like anyone you choose.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.540
I'm the Eldest Princess.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.060
Must I bind you to me?

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.580
Right.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.820
You're right, Your Highness.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.860
It's entirely my freedom

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.540
to choose which woman I favor.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.060
What's so funny?

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.020
When I offered to let you go with her,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.900
you refused.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.460
If you really meant it,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.700
I would have no choice but to obey.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.140
After all,

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.940
I'm merely a follower.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:39.940
Get out!

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:42.980
As you wish.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.060
I'll take my leave.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.300
You're really leaving.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.060
Now, you're obedient.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.540
Why the long face?

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.500
Because I didn't tell you?

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.700
I knew you would come,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.220
but why did you start with Xue Hanmei?

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.500
If there's a problem

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.820
with one of those followers,

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:46.940
I should start

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.820
with an acquaintance.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.860
But Xue Hanmei

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.820
isn't an acquaintance.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.020
What if he's the one

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.940
who has a problem?

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.500
You're being strange.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.940
I...

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.220
You...

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.980
You could just speak.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.860
Why did you move over?

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.260
And you...

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.820
You touched me.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.420
Just a gentle stroke.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.740
You look a bit pale.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.980
Do you feel unwell?

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.100
Really unwell?

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.340
Then tell me what's wrong.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.660
Tell me about it.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.780
Come on. You can whisper.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.500
Sit back there,

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.340
and I won't be angry.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.860
Who said you were angry?

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.420
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.820
Xiaoqi,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.740
are you here for me?

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.460
You cute little thing.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.220
Chu Yu,

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.300
give it a new name, will you?

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.260
I think Xiaoqi is a good name.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.140
Right, puppy?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.060
If my brother were still alive,

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.380
would you really marry him?

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.980
Why did you ask

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.500
such a weird question?

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.300
If...

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.940
I mean, if.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.980
Your brother was one of the best men

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.380
in this world.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.820
If he were alive,

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.740
he might have met another girl.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.100
But in this world,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.820
there are no "ifs".

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.380
What should I bring
to the auction banquet?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.660
How about I bring you?

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.740
I won't give you up.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.700
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.060
Be with me.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.740
If you refuse,

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.860
I'll tell everyone

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.380
that you're trying to hit on me.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.580
What scares you?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.420
Does this mean

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.740
you like me?

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.540
I don't like you.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.740
If you don't like me,

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.860
why would you hide

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.060
my bell?

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.820
If you don't like me,

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.100
why would you get jealous

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:40.980
when you saw me

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.860
talk to another man?

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.580
If you don't like me,

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.580
why can't you even look at me now?

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.460
Back in the Spring Breeze House,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.300
you were the first man I saw.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.580
I know you like me.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.700
Am I right?

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.020
Wei Yun.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.220
Why would I have a dream like that?

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.220
Wei Yun,

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.100
how could you do this?

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.540
No.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.020
Nothing happened between them.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.420
What if I do it anyway?

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.500
(Qinxi Valley)

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.580
Ms. Chu Jin.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.300
Ms. Chu Jin,

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.660
I thought you wouldn't come.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.420
Thank you for the invitation.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.260
It's your first invitation.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.660
Of course I'd come.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.420
Ms. Chu Jin.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.140
Wenchang,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.140
you're quite active.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.860
When you don't even know love,

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.700
you won't understand.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.540
She's the prettiest woman in town.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.700
If I didn't move,

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.020
someone else would.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.140
Why isn't General Chu here?

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.220
My brother is too busy with work

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.860
to come here.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.660
That makes sense.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.060
General Chu is a quiet man

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.620
and he doesn't like noisy places.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.820
Oh, Ms. Chu Jin.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.060
I've got a certain herb

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.300
that is good for General Chu's health.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.620
I was wondering when I could deliver it.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.220
Since we've met now,

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.060
please take it to him.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.020
You certainly care about him.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.700
Allow me to thank you on his behalf.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.420
Quan'er.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.420
Yes, My Lady.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.780
This is for the herb.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.140
If it's not enough,

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.860
I'll pay the rest another day.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.100
You get me wrong.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.020
That's not what I mean.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.180
I'm just concerned

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.380
about General Chu's health.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.860
I can't take the money.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.900
You must take it.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.300
Ms. Chu Jin,

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.020
I'm not helping General Chu

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.740
to earn any money.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.660
You can reject it,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.780
but I must give you some.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.700
I can't take this.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.020
Please, take it.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.180
Ms. Chu Jin, take it back.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.020
- What happened?
- Take it.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.170
- Weren't they fine?
- No.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.580
- Ms. Chu Jin.
- Please, take it.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.500
It's been a moment.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.580
Why are you arguing?

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.180
Ms. Chu Jin misunderstood me.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.380
She insists on paying me

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.420
for General Chu.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.980
I can't take the money.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.340
It's my rule.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.220
I never take anything I don't deserve.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.340
And it's right when a patient

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.340
pays for his treatment.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.340
Miss Song, please, just take it.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.020
Mrs. Wei is here.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.020
She looks gorgeous.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.780
The Marquis of Zhenguo

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.060
is really wealthy.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.580
Her clothes

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.620
and jewels

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.860
are all exquisite.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.380
I hadn't noticed before,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.220
but today, she looks stunning.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.300
Ms. Chu Yu,

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.340
you look gorgeous.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.020
Are you saying

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.540
I wasn't gorgeous before?

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.860
You know

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.020
that's not what I mean.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.180
I certainly know.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.180
Jin.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.980
Did you come with Linyang?

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.740
Ms. Chu Jin.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.420
Here.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.660
What is this, Mr. Song?

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.980
It's the auction banquet.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.380
I know

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.940
you must have many treasures.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.860
But since you're my guest,

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.900
I should prepare one for you.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.220
So,

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.460
it's the birthday gift

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.500
I received last year.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.140
Ms. Chu Jin,

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.380
hope you'll like it.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.380
I thought you might think

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.020
I didn't have any treasures.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.020
Not at all.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.820
I invited you.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.340
So, I wouldn't let you pay.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.780
That's just good hospitality.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.980
It's my rule, too.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.320
Your literary talent has improved.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.940
So has yours, Chang.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.650
The color you used last time was nice.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.230
Yeah.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.070
You flatter me.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.870
Glad you like it.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.540
Of course. Let's go.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.260
Gu...

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.120
It's a really nice place.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.820
Yeah. The view over there is good, too.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.580
It's too hot.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.340
General Yao.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.780
Mrs. Wei.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:50.620
I've heard a lot about you.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.340
I heard in the Battle of Baidi Valley,

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.260
you fought fearlessly,

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.180
regardless of life.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.540
And you were wounded.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.500
It's a blessing for our nation

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.580
to have a patriot like you.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.420
I also saw how you knelt

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.340
in front of the palace gate all night.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.460
You're extraordinary

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.980
just as people say.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.340
Where is Young Marquis?

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.700
I was too busy working

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.220
to attend his succession banquet

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.380
or congratulate him.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.700
I only had some gifts sent.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.340
This time, I'm hoping

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.580
to congratulate him in person.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.260
Yao Yong won't reject

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.980
Her Highness's invitation.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.220
So, he will be there.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.860
In that case,

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.300
let's split up.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.740
One of us stalls Yao Yong at the banquet

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.020
while the other sneaks into his house

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.220
for some evidence.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.500
Be very careful

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.500
during the banquet.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.220
Don't have a problem with him.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.740
Why do I have to be there?

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.380
I fight as well as you.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.540
You didn't tell me before you

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.500
sneaked in there.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.060
So, on this matter,

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.180
I have the final say.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.180
Fine.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.020
Since we can't agree,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.060
let's leave our luck

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:04.900
in the hands of fate.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.700
Coin toss.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.980
Heads, you'll go. Tails, I'll go.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.180
Deal?

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.700
(Yuanle Coin)

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.900
We had a deal.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.020
Heads.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.340
(Yao Mansion)
I'll go to the Yao's.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.820
How could a marquis like you

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.100
even cheat?

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.380
Thanks for your concern.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.620
Wen Yun

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.580
is also busy working today.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.260
Once he's done,

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.540
he will come.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.580
Send word to my family.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.740
Yes.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.580
General Yao.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.020
Are you leaving already?

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.940
I have a family emergency.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.340
I'm too worried to stay.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.420
I have to go.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.300
Her Highness hasn't arrived yet.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.660
Is it appropriate

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.900
for you to leave now?

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.260
The Eldest Princess is here.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.900
Think about it.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.500
Now that you're here,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.020
if you leave now,

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.980
you will ruin

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.620
Her Highness's mood.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.220
Master is out today.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.740
The two of you must stay alert.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.580
No one enters the study.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.180
If anything happens,

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.660
let me know immediately.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.420
(Wise and Wily)
Yes.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.100
Don't you remember

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.940
his warning?

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.020
Crows like shiny things.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.340
They usually steal silver.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.340
It will be fine.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.340
If you don't go, I'll get it all.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.460
Here's some more.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.660
That's a lot.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.500
- Go.
- Come on.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.420
(Wise and Wily)

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.740
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.980
Rise.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.780
Sit.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.820
All of you are

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.020
either nobles

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.500
or high-ranking officials.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.260
I stated why I would

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.660
hold this auction banquet

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.700
on the invitation.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.800
Since you're here,

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.500
you must be prepared.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.500
I don't need to say more.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.540
Hanmei.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.740
The first item is from Her Highness.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.220
This is a white jade ring.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:10.860
It looks smooth

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.060
and shiny.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.300
Truly priceless.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.220
It was from His Majesty.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.420
The one and only throughout the nation.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.980
Her Highness did her part.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.100
Let's see what you will offer.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.220
(This is from His Majesty.)

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.780
(Who would dare to bid?)

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.820
Since nobody wants

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.420
to be the first bidder,

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.740
I will

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.180
start you off.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.980
I bid 100 taels

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.340
for this jade ring.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.180
No one else bids

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.380
for this white jade ring.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.140
So, it's sold for 100 taels.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.460
Congratulations, Your Highness.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.220
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.980
A gear lock.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.340
I can open it.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.580
When?

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.100
In a quarter.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.620
You truly are awesome, Mrs. Wei.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.380
You're brave enough to pioneer

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.940
and you have a sincere

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.100
and devoted heart.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.340
You flatter me.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.980
General Yao.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.780
You went to the battlefront.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.820
You must know

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.460
about the hard life of border soldiers.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:09.500
I wonder

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.940
what treasure

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.820
you're going to offer.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.980
How about I buy your dagger

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.500
with 80 taels?

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.740
What do you say?

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.860
Thank you, General Yao.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.180
80 taels.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.020
Sold.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.300
General,

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.620
did you really not bring anything?

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.860
It's generous of you.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.620
It's halfway through.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.140
You may take a break.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.740
Get my carriage to the gate.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.780
We're going back.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.860
Yes.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.340
Help! An assassin!

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.340
North Qi assassin!

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.620
That's Ms. Chu Yu's voice.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.020
Assassin? Where?

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.580
Such audacity!

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.060
Seal this place.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.220
Yes.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.340
How dare you?

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.060
The assassin ran back there.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.100
Stay put.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.740
Gu.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.220
I'll lead some guards to get him.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.540
I'll join him.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.620
Granted.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.780
Your Highness, there's an assassin.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.620
My Lady.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.780
Your Highness, an assassin sneaked in.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.140
He was using a scimitar,

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.660
the kind only the North Qi people use.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.420
That's a lie!

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.260
(Yao Yong secretly keeps weapons.)

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.420
General sent word back.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.620
Wei Yun might be in here.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.460
Only the study is unchecked.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.820
Close in on it.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.860
Don't let them run away.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.020
(Wise and Wily)

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.980
Just now in the yard, I saw with my eyes

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.220
that you cut

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.420
your own arm.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.780
Is that true?

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.780
Why would I do that?

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.940
Ms. Wang, did you see it wrong?

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.100
I swear I didn't.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.420
And I swear

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.140
I saw what happened

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.940
and I'm telling the absolute truth.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.460
Otherwise...

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.500
Otherwise, may I

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.460
be struck dead.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.180
If Ms. Wang is telling the truth,

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.460
does that mean Mrs. Wei

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.740
made up the assassin story

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.100
to make people suspect

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.300
that Her Highness

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.580
is colluding with the North Qi?

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:15.420
We'll know

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.980
if Mrs. Wei was assassinated

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.780
after she's examined.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.420
You used to be a physician.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.020
Go check on her

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.220
and prove her innocence.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:26.900
Yes.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.660
General Yao, you're overstepping.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.860
Since when

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.140
are you the master

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.500
of this place?

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.940
Why do you have the final say?

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.300
Your Highness,

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.300
I wouldn't dare.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.620
I just want you to be safe.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.260
And who do you think you are?

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.780
How can you be a physician

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.620
as he says you are?

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.780
Who can vouch for you?

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.260
Your Highness,

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.860
he went to battles with me.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:55.720
There, I...

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.820
You want to vouch for your man,

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.780
no problem.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.280
Then why do you

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.620
have to doubt

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.580
what Mrs. Wei says?

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.300
And besides,

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.860
he's a strange man.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.140
How could he check on her?

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.780
General Yao,

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.100
what are you actually up to?

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.980
It was thoughtless of me.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.180
Please summon an imperial physician

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.580
to examine Mrs. Wei.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.380
Don't bother.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.460
Tuantuan.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.180
Yes, Your Highness.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.940
Oh, no.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:45.220
Let's go.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.060
After him.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.020
It's a cut of a dagger, not a scimitar.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.140
That assassin was vicious.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.060
Her wound is very long,

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.940
just like a red crescent moon.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.060
It's a deep cut and looks dreadful.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.300
He must have

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.660
stabbed her with great force.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.940
Your Highness,

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.300
you need to figure out

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.780
how that assassin sneaked in here

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.740
and why he tried to kill Ms. Chu Yu.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.900
Someone dared to kill

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.580
in broad daylight.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.020
He was being outrageous.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.260
How come?

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.660
You were always so fierce, weren't you?

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.740
Why did you get hurt this time?

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:50.980
Watch out, Chu Yu!
