=Episode 15=

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.480
Well,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.350
you dared to come here.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.410
I'll ensure you never leave.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.320
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.750
I dirtied the Princess's sachet.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.960
Allow me to clean it and return it later.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.350
Ah, very well.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.250
Have it your way.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.120
(It seems I am of use to the Prince.)

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.680
(If that's so,)

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.560
(I'll play along.)

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.230
(I must find proof
that he killed the Prefect.)

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.560
(Only by bringing him down)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(can I free my father.)

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.640
Lady Xu is quite beautiful

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.200
and skilled at the zither, too.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.910
Marvelous.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.070
Your Highness,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.920
Lady Xu has been married before.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.760
Just a woman.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.310
How could I possibly fall for her?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.230
Marrying her serves another purpose.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.790
You mean...?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.280
The Xu family

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.870
is the capital's largest herb merchant,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
with shops all over the country.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.310
Taking her means gaining all those shops.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.920
Discreet and useful, right?

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.350
Brilliant, Your Highness.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.790
But this woman seems far from simple.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.120
Exactly why

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.590
she should stay right under my eyes.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.840
Someone dared to steal here.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.520
Such audacity.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.240
Search thoroughly.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.730
Princess.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.280
Especially outsiders who entered today.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.240
Search them thoroughly.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.240
Princess, you mean...?

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.120
Wanning, something has been stolen

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.770
I'm conducting a search.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.560
You happened to visit today,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.080
so you must be searched as well.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.080
I have taken nothing from here.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.590
Of course I believe you.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.190
But if I don't have you searched,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.190
how will the others respect my authority

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.400
in the household?

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.750
I'm afraid I have to do this.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.840
Search her.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.120
Yes.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.680
Princess.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.150
What's going on here?

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.150
Heng, what brings you here?

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.030
To see if the Princess returned safely.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.630
If that's the case,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.520
come inside for tea.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.590
All right.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.280
Princess,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.750
please dismiss these other people.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.520
Don't let them get in the way.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.630
All of you, leave.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.840
Yes.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.700
(Xu Residence)

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.270
This is perfect.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.150
This way,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.870
I can proceed with my plan.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.720
My Lady, the Prince requests your presence.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.270
Hongmei, help me get dressed.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.640
Yes.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.920
I never imagined the Prince would invite me.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.000
I feel greatly honored.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.390
It truly delights me

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.800
to see you today.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.560
Yesterday, I heard you play a tune.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.870
It was like celestial music.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.040
Pity it was only a few notes.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.870
Might I hear a full piece today?

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.240
Hearing your words was like
meeting a kindred spirit.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.480
Today, I shall not play for a prince,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.390
but for that kindred spirit.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.310
A kindred spirit?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.510
Good. Even better so.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.040
Heng,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.520
you must be tired.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.420
I had them

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.780
prepare the osmanthus cake
you loved as a child.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.960
Have a taste.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.640
Here.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.000
Your Highness.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.430
I'm afraid this is improper.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.660
It's a breach of etiquette.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.240
Don't be so restrained around me.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.990
I am but a commoner.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.610
How could I be worthy?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.600
If you were to become my consort,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.260
would you still be so restrained?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.160
I hear a touch

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.600
of sorrow in your music.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.270
Is there something troubling you?

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.600
Your Highness is perceptive.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.750
It's all because my father was imprisoned.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.430
I have heard about that matter.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.480
I only said that just now

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.950
to ease your mood.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.950
I hope I did not offend you.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.270
Your Highness jests.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.750
How could that be an offense?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.830
To me, it is the greatest of blessings.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.600
Like something from a fairy tale.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.000
I was a bit rude just now.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.510
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.480
It's all right.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.430
However, I truly can
ease the worries in your heart.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.750
You might want to consider it.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.510
Your Highness, thank you
for easing my sorrow.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.430
I shall continue playing for you.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.670
Thank you for escorting me.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.360
I should thank you.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.390
To hear such music

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.120
is my great fortune.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.470
Let go.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.350
What?

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.750
Afraid the Prince might see

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.600
and your hopes
of being his consort be ruined?

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.750
Exactly.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.550
And I'd not want
to ruin your prospects either.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.990
Are you jealous?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.910
Did you come just to ask me this?

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.080
You saw today

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.080
how the Princess treated you.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.630
If it weren't for me...

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.630
Thank you.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.510
I know what you're trying to do.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.280
But it's too dangerous.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.480
Are you going to gamble your own happiness

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.240
and return to that mire?

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.630
Tell me,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.150
how else can a commoner

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.200
stand against a prince?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.080
I'm close to finding the evidence

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.680
of the Prince dealing Hongzhen Incense.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.040
Just wait for me.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.510
You're investigating the case,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.670
but I'm saving my father.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.670
I cannot just wait and do nothing.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.630
Every delay endangers my father.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.030
He's loved me dearly since I was little.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.790
I can't possibly let him

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.510
remain in danger.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.550
Wanning, you're home.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.030
Come. Have a seat.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.890
Sit down.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.030
Wanning, you've worked yourself

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.150
to the bone lately.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.080
I had the kitchen stew a chicken

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.160
to strengthen your health.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.960
You are the eldest legitimate daughter.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.120
You must take care of yourself.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.390
In the future,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.480
your younger siblings will rely on you.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.390
Of course, I will help them

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.750
where I can.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.080
No need to put it like that.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.550
How could that be?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.000
You'll be the Prince's consort,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.320
and they will all look up to you.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.200
What are you talking about?

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.910
Look, this was sent by the Prince today.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.720
If you agree,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.150
he'll send the betrothal gifts tomorrow.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.670
(Gift List)

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.000
You've already been divorced

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.630
and with a child to care for.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.550
To remarry at all is a blessing,

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.350
let alone

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.080
to a prince.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.670
What is there to hesitate about?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.570
Wanning,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.240
even if not for yourself,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.910
you must consider your younger siblings

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.150
and Chang'an.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.910
Once he enters the Prince's household,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.910
he'll surely be granted a title.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.080
Even if you ignore all that,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.910
just look at this generous gift list.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.200
Aren't you tempted?

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.910
No need to look.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.120
The Prince considers me worthy as a consort

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.390
is our family's greatest fortune.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.930
Besides, with Father imprisoned,

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.630
becoming his consort

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.870
might give me a way to save him.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.150
Oh dear.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.440
There you go.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.960
I thought you wouldn't agree.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.280
Since that's settled,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.150
I'll send word to the Prince tomorrow

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.030
to proceed.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.360
Thank you, Auntie.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.110
All right.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.510
Xiaoxiao, that's enough.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.800
Father,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.240
are you truly set on marrying Xu Wanning?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.390
I know you've long been friends.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.480
If she becomes my consort,

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.240
you can see each other every day.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.320
Won't that be lovely?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
In the past, we were close as sisters.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.720
Now, if you marry her,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.960
I will have to kneel and salute her.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.320
How do you expect me to face her?

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.600
Do as propriety demands.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.200
Do not break the rules

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.750
and cause me to lose face.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.390
Lose face?

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.600
Father, would you still care about that?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.910
If you marry that scheming woman,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.790
you'll disgrace the entire family.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.030
Enough.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.670
Every word I said is true.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.720
Back then, after she lost her virtue
at the poetry gathering,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.360
her scandal spread far and wide.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.150
Even my name was tarnished by it.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.390
Now,

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.000
you disregard your own reputation
to marry her.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.750
Have you ever cared
about my reputation?

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.600
If you cared for that,

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.670
you wouldn't have

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.270
stayed single all these years

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.340
- I...
- for that impotent Pei Heng.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.960
You...

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.120
Remember this.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.480
You're Princess Anle

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.720
only because you're my daughter.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.270
If I want to remarry,

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.070
I do not need your approval.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.670
Xu Wanning,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.910
you ruined my reputation

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.000
at the poetry gathering.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.120
Even Heng grew distant because of you.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.600
Now, you've returned to the Capital City.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.270
Not only have you grown close to Heng,

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.440
you even attempt to marry my father.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.030
Then, don't blame me

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.320
for disregarding our past friendship.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.750
My Lady,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.270
do you really want to marry the Prince?

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.600
Why don't you ask whether the Prince
truly wants to marry me?

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.480
The Prince has sent
the betrothal letter and gift list.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.930
How could that be false?

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.320
Then why do you think the Prince

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.670
wants to marry a divorcée?

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.600
Surely because he adores you.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.080
The Prince's move is

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.390
to control me and drag the Xu family down

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.120
with him.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.870
Our shops across the country

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.320
are perfect for him to use

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.790
for selling Hongzhen Incense.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.270
Then you should not marry him.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.480
The Prince is using an open scheme.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.270
Today he tested me with my father's case,

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.240
and sent the betrothal gifts right after.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.840
So,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.600
even knowing it's a trap,

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.720
I must step right in.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.710
My Lady.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.480
Don't worry, Hongmei.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.080
I'll deal with whatever comes.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.750
He wants to keep me under his nose,

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.550
and I want to get close to him

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.910
to gather evidence of his crimes.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.510
We'll see in the end who wins.
