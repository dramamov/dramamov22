I don't have that kind of luck.

You think this is something good?

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.560
If I had seen anything,

-Captain Song.
-I would have been on TV long ago.

The maggots have already pupated.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.479
I think the victim has already been dead

Her body is all rotten.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.509
It's not easy to examine it.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.280
We need to take it back
for a thorough examination.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.210
Maybe it's related to this bottle.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.340
Isn't this the same as that one?

The same method.

There's a suspect.

Who?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.889
The girl's boyfriend.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.710
That makes sense.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.710
Why?

Love turned to hate.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.630
The more he loved, the more he hated.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.110
I remember you suspected

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.360
that this was a serial case,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.000
right?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.800
It seems that Liu Ke's case

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.329
is indeed not the first one.

This case

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.370

Here, have a cigarette.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.400
I don't smoke.

Just take one.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.000
He's just guessing.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.350
Guessing?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.150
Many major cases

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.870
were solved

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.630
based on guessing.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.840
What do you say to that?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.000
But here is one thing.

it's always the same few people
who guess right.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.430
The case is solved.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.390
Why does your apprentice

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.650
look like he's lost his soul?

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.510
He's stubborn.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.830
He's stubborn, but he's a good material.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.830
He's not like you.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.310
What's wrong with me?

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.170
You're greasy.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.070
Think about bearings.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.560
Can it even spin without grease?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.800
It would just be a dead lump.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.930
It would be useless.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.990
My mentor-apprentice pairing is right,
isn't it?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.240
Of course it's right.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.310
Your leadership is brilliant.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.110
Finally, you're talking sense.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.230
By the way,

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.360
your wife's business

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.160
is doing well.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.940
It made the newspaper.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.600
Come on, drink up.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.760
Together.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.800
Interview us?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.510
Yes.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.600
The coverage of you

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.680
by foreign journalists

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.150
has attracted attention.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.510
It's proof of our city's reform

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.510
and ideological development.

It really did make the newspaper.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.330
May I ask

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.390
which one of you is the boss?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.720
Her.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.240
Him.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.950
Well.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.800
Alright.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.950
Then we'll interview you together.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.810
Yes, together.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.390
May I ask how you two,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.240
as a couple, came up with

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.160
the idea of opening

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.950
an adult health products store?

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.270
We're not a couple.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.060
Right, we're not married.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.830
Then I'd like to ask

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.830
why this store

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.430
is called ADAN&EVE?

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.390
”Adan and Eve“

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.560
actually represents men and women.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.600
More importantly,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.730
it represents love.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.750
We Chinese people

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.160
are quite reserved

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.190
when expressing love

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.510
and are not good at expressing it.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.990
I

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.390
want to use this name

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.920
to encourage us

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.240
to be bolder

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.570
when expressing love.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.080
Yes.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.750
Camera.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.669
Bolder.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.630
Okay. Here.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.440
Thank you.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.360
So why did you

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.289
open this store?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.150
-Because this is—
-Sir.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.880
You can just stand up straight.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.000
Because this is

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.120
a brand new field

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.840
and an excellent business opportunity.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.270
More importantly,

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.000
it demonstrates

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.320
that under reform and opening up,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.510
times are progressing.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.200
Just look at

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.960
our products—

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.080
Comrade, the line...

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.480
Just stand here and speak.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.080
Just take

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.200
our products, for example.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.510
They all represent

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.090
the rising happiness index

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.180
of Chinese people.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.150
So,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.390
under the breeze
of reform and opening up,

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.200
we'd like to

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.480
be the pioneers of our time.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.390
Put it here.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.270
We'd like to

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.800
be the pioneers of our time.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.530
Therefore,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.480
Beiping and I

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.080
both coincidentally

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.320
opened this store.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.480
Although some people don't understand,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.600
and even have some—

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.320
Put it here.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.000
and even have some misunderstandings
about us,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.030
but we will

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.120
persevere until the end.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.960
Microphone.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.910
Eventually, they will understand

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.600
that we've done something right,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.930
something meaningful.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:30.960
Come.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.680
Thank you.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.360
You spoke so well.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.790
What do you think?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.240
Actually, at first we

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.750
wanted to name it
"Nüwa Mends the Sky."

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.120
But it was missing a male figure.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.570
Then we thought of naming it
"Pangu Creates the World."

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.360
But there were no women inside it,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.480
so we ended up calling it "Adan and Eve."

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:50.960
Right.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.210
Now we have both men and women figures.

Mentor.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.960
Why did you

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.400
suddenly disappear?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.390
I'm not good at drinking alcohol,

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.030
so I went for a walk.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.270
I went back to take a look.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.720
Where?

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.750
Under the bridge.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.250
Mentor, do you think it was Crazy Monk?

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.270
What do you think?

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.150
I originally thought it was him,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.350
but seeing his reaction today...

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.600
Are you crazy?

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.360
The suspect is already in custody.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.200
Yet you're still obsessing over this.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.350
With your doing,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.720
would the Criminal Police Team
even want you?

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.150
I just feel something's not right.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.150
You're not right.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.370
Let me tell you,

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.240
I've seen

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.390
plenty of people like you,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.510
so obsessed with solving cases,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.570
in the end, none of them turn out well.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.600
These bastards.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.610
They are all actors.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.160
They're all good at acting.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.510
When I was still
in the Criminal Police Team,

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.770
there was a colleague,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.000
Mr. Qin.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.530
He was working on a forged signature case.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.870
He investigated for over six months

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.670
but couldn't catch the suspect.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.870
One time,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.120
he was delivering documents
to the Director.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.920
After the Director signed them,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
he thought the handwriting looked similar.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.450
He tackled the chief

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.640
to the ground with one big swing.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.530
On that very day,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.960
I saw myself...

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.970
So, I submitted my resignation
to the leader

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.200
and left.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.440
In the future,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.080
don't become like that.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.150
Crazy.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.480
Understand?

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:47.710
I understand.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.410
But I still want to investigate it.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.200
You...

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.070
You really are

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.890
as stubborn as a mule, aren't you?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.340
Let me tell you.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.110
These words of yours—

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.000
Just tell me.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.670
Well, I'm

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.390
drunk

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.400
and will go home to sleep.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.720
And when I wake up,

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.670
I'll forget all about it.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.220
Alright, Zhu Dachuan.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.600
You haven't said anything all day.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.450
There's nothing to say.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.270
Fine.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.320
Let's all take a break then.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.080
I just grabbed

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.910
a newspaper with me.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.040
Let me read it to you.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.270
This headline—

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.960
"Wealthy Woman Found Dead in Cadillac;

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.670
the Killer Turns Out
to Be Her New Boyfriend.“

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.200
This seems quite relevant to you.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.600
Both involve Cadillacs.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.630
This hardworking woman

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.030
who earned money for her boyfriend

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.120
never imagined

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.080
that her always gentle
and caring boyfriend

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.170
would reach out

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.370
with his criminal hand at this moment.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.230
Officer,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.030
you need to talk

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.000
to the residents around here

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.840
properly.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.630
They can't dump garbage here.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.260
Look.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.870
Just fifty meters ahead

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.150
is the garbage station.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.790
Ms. Du,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.320
we've told them many times.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.670
But now there's talk of demolition,

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.270
so everyone cares even less.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.240
Well, how about this?

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.970
Take a few people in

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.530
and teach them a lesson.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.600
We can't just stand here

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.270
catching people who litter.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.440
Then who's going to handle this
if you don't?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.750
These residents around here

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.150
don't listen to us at all.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:02.960
Han,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.360
quickly, let's get this cart

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:04.870
Got it!

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.530
out of here.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.680
This is really frustrating.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.280
What's wrong?

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.610
You think solving a big case

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.480
means everyone's gotta
treat you like a hero?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.510
But they can't have police officers

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.110
guarding garbage every day.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:18.720
[No Littering]

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720
From murder cases

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.970
to picking up trash,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.130
patrol cops have to handle it all.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.090
Slow down.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.550
Take the turn slowly.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.150
Slow down.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.440
Stop!

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.000
Stop.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.630
Stop.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.390
Stop!

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.910
Stop! Stop!

What instructions do you have now?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.910
You've already caught Crazy Monk.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.960
Are you trying to mess with me now?

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960
Cut the nonsense.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.080
You can't escape
if you do anything wrong, either.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.960
I need to borrow some people from you.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.510
Who?

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.150

Who?

Come on.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.690
Help pick these up.

If they get dirty, Little Erhei will

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.750
buy you new ones.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.100
Mentor, what are you trying to do?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.840
You "Four Horses."

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.080
I've already talked

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.870
to your boss Erhei.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.910
This place isn't far from the nightclub.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.120
it's all your responsibility.

Look,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.830
these "Four horses,"

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.040
can't take him back.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.000
Hello.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.940
Officer Zhao, you're back again.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.720
I'd like to take another look.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.450
Is that okay?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.440
Of course.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.690
Why wouldn't it be?

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.960
My poor sister.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.839
She had such a hard life.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.240
And her daughter had a tough life, too.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.640
This child was so good.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.680
She was very well-behaved since childhood,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.270
always asking me for candy.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.640
After eating the candy,

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.440
she would save all the wrappers.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.480
She has loved beauty
since she was little.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.160
Her father couldn't afford

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.440
to buy her new clothes.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.880
So she made them herself.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.170
This used to be our curtain.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.170
I'm going to burn all of these anyway.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.730
I can't bear to look at them.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.200
It hurts too much.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.240
You don't want any of these anymore?

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.240
No, I don't. I'll just burn them all.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.310
Could I keep them?

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.830
What do you want them for?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.560

Well,

haven't you already caught the murderer?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.270
We'd like to keep the victim's belongings

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.240
for our records.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.640
They said Zhang Dan was killed

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.550
because she went down the wrong path.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.280
Is that true?

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.080
Zhang Dan was a good girl.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.250
It's the killer who was bad.

No, no, no.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.920
Well...

I can't visit you without a reason,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.960

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.720
No.

You're a busy person.

you have a connection
with that Crazy Monk.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.180
What connection would I have
with that thug?

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.160
Come on.

If you had no connection,

how could you

capture him single-handedly?

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.480
That was just a lucky accident.

Our Criminal Police Team

And I don't trust the young ones.

Now we're dealing with this Crazy Monk

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.520
who responds to gentle approaches,
not force.

So, I'm old and gentle, huh?

What do you mean by "old and gentle"?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.440
I was just thinking...

You two have been interrogating him
for so long.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.510
If you push him a little harder,
won't he just confess?

No, don't bother.

Sit down, sit down.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.070
It's right here.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.000
Sit down!

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.750
Sit down!

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.120
Can you just help me out?

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.970
Helping with a case is my duty.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.240
I just have one request.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.340
Go ahead.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.480
Could you transfer

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:06.750
Zhao to your team?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.790
Some mentor you are,

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.480
pushing your apprentice away.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.000
No, the kid really

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.690
has talent for solving cases.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.030
Keeping him at the police station

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:15.750
is a waste.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.680
If you interrogate Crazy Monk for me,

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.830
I'll transfer both of you.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:27.840
Count me out.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.200
In the future,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.780
just take good care of him.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.920
The kid is stubborn

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.750
and prone to doing stupid things.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.720
I can see that.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.810
He takes after his mentor.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.240
Don't tell anyone

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.510
this was my suggestion,

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.680
or I'll deny it.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.210
I immediately lost interest.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:44.920
Really.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:46.550
It was pointless.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.200
Here, have some tea.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:49.920
I remember

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.360
your old catchphrase was

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.690
"interesting."

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.230
My mother died.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.190
And she didn't even wait for me

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:02.320
to get out of prison.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.760
My mother died,

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.580
and nothing matters anymore.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:14.030
Now,

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:16.840
nothing is interesting.
