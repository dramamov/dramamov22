WEBVTT

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.000
AE...

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.792
You're so cute, Chiaki...

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:26.375
No.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.833
AE... Are you hiding
something from me?

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.792
I know. AE is Enaga...

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.542
I know. AE is Enaga...

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:53.750
AE is Enaga...

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:55.635
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:21.667
Why on earth aren't you
getting enough sleep?

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.500
I had a nightmare this morning...

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.792
A nightmare?

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.167
Yeah, sort of...

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.375
You're probably just overworked.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.583
Speaking of which, AE, you have it rough.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.208
Going to fashion design
school at night, right?

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.667
Do you manage to stay
under the radar at school?

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.417
I'm holding up pretty well.

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:50.333
A condition of my enrollment was
that my identity not be revealed.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.125
So, are you having nightmares
about your competition piece?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.042
Nah, it's about relationship stuff.

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:05.750
Romance! I never would've guessed.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.917
AE, I thought you were
just clumsy with your hands.

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:12.167
Turns out you're dense
when it comes to love, too.

00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:15.625
And here I thought I was pretty good at it.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.042
What, are you trying to make me jealous?

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:19.167
Make you jealous?

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:23.083
Because being this awkward...
it just means you really like them.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:30.417
Yeah, very much.

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:34.208
Ugh, enough with the lovey-dovey talk!

00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:40.375
After our weekend night out...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.250
I finally realized it.

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:46.039
I...

00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.208
I like Chiaki.

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:58.542
But... that feeling.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:04.125
Someone who doesn't keep secrets...

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.875
I wonder if something
happened to him in the past.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.750
If I like Chiaki,

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:17.167
and want to build a
genuine relationship with him...

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:22.042
All done! Perfect again today.

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:28.167
Not as AE, but as my true self.

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:32.125
Excuse me.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.833
AE, are you ready?

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.292
Ready.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.042
Alright, go on, you clumsy oaf.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.333
I'm off.

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.417
I have to tell him I'm Enaga.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.875
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 4)

00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.333
Whoa, the stuff downstairs is amazing.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.833
This is so cool!

00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.583
See? This place is incredible.

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.000
They have a lot of other
interesting pieces here, too.

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:14.042
I'm gonna go try this on.

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:15.792
Excuse me...

00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:18.792
Sumiura!

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.625
Welcome.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:25.458
Oh, right. You work here, don't you?

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:30.167
Trying it on?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.208
I'll show you to the fitting
room. Right this way.

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:34.792
Thanks.

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:47.417
AE modeled this piece, right?

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:50.958
Yes, this one's very popular.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.683
This is the only store in the
country that still has it in stock.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.042
AE... Ever since then, he's left
me on read and just ghosted me.

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:19.917
Sumiura seems really down today.

00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:23.167
You think? It's probably
because he's at work.

00:06:23.292 --> 00:06:27.583
That's all the more reason
he should act a little more cheerful.

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:45.625
Excuse me.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.917
This... do you have it in a size small?

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.917
Yes, a size small...

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:57.375
Does this mean I'll never see AE again?

00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:01.750
If I can't ever see AE again...

00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:05.458
the only path left for me is...

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.750
to win the competition.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:21.292
Everyone, can I have your attention?

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:25.208
Regarding the competition
you're all working on,

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:27.333
we've had a scheduling
conflict with the models.

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:31.583
So this time, one person from each pair
will have to walk the runway.

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:32.958
Huh!?

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:35.917
That's all. Okay, back to work, everyone.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.000
Shino-san, what are we going to do?

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:38.875
Haruka, you should do it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.458
No way! Rock-paper-scissors?

00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:42.292
Rock-paper-scissors?

00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:45.125
Oh, great. I have to be
the model? What a pain.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.458
You say that, but you're
actually excited, aren't you?

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:51.542
A model, huh? Enaga, you should do it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.250
You're tall.

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:57.792
Look, like that model AE?

00:07:57.917 --> 00:07:59.357
You're about the same height, right?

00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:03.583
He's pretending not to know again...

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:05.208
So cute.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:11.417
No! I have to turn this
down, no matter what.

00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:17.375
I'm too clumsy. I can't
even walk in a straight line.

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.375
What does being clumsy have to do with it?

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:23.000
Maybe so...

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.125
Enaga, you do look like
you might trip and fall.

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.250
Sumiura, you look like
you'd be good at this.

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:33.208
Why don't you give it a try?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.875
Huh? Me?

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.625
Walking the runway as a model...

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.083
Yeah.

00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.583
Just like AE.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.500
Like this?

00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:18.708
Not bad. That's great.

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:20.208
Really?

00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:21.750
You kept your gaze steady.

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:24.125
And you walked heel-to-toe
in a perfectly straight line.

00:09:24.542 --> 00:09:27.458
No way... Are you a
professional or something?

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:32.917
But seriously, I'm impressed.
Sumiura, you're a natural.

00:09:36.458 --> 00:09:40.708
He's blushing. How cute.

00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:43.833
Sumiura, that was a really good walk.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.167
I never knew you had it in you!

00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:47.292
Yeah.

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:51.625
Arguing about it is just a waste of time.

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:55.292
Whatever, I'll do it.

00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:59.268
Anyway, about the production. How
are the design sketches coming along?

00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:03.542
If you have some ideas,
let's share them with each other.

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:06.958
I've been looking forward to
seeing your designs, Sumiura.

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:27.625
Enaga's is... punk.

00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:32.208
Sumiura, why isn't yours punk style?

00:10:36.292 --> 00:10:39.583
I was so excited when I heard
the theme was "a night out."

00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:44.375
I thought you'd get to show off
your signature punk style.

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:49.417
Don't tell me... you got scared off?

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:53.792
Because, about the punk theme before...

00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.833
It's just not working.

00:10:57.167 --> 00:11:02.875
You just want to do punk, so you're
forcing the concept onto the design.

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:06.792
You know, I think what the teacher meant was,
"Don't just default to a specific genre."

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:09.000
Not that you shouldn't
do punk at all, right?

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:15.708
Didn't you say it takes courage
to go out clubbing for the first time?

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:21.833
And that you wanted to design an outfit
that could give those people courage?

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:29.000
(Shoot... I said too much.)

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:33.250
(I can't help myself when
it comes to clothes...)

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:37.625
Sorry, I didn't mean to
sound like I was lecturing you.

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.167
Enaga, you're right.

00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:48.417
I was a little intimidated
by what happened last time.

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:54.375
Seeing your design made
me realize something.

00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:58.667
"An outfit that gives you
courage for a night out."

00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:00.583
It has to be punk. There's no other way.

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:09.417
I thought you were just clumsy,
but you're actually quite principled.

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:11.250
You really have a mind of your own.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.333
Was I being blabbing too much?

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:15.000
A little, yeah.

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.023
But it's better than someone
who doesn't say anything at all.

00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:28.042
Alright, let's get back to brainstorming.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.458
Enaga, using these two intersecting colors
to express human connection is brilliant.

00:12:33.583 --> 00:12:38.583
Sumiura, your use of bead patterns
to evoke neon city lights is so romantic.

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:43.458
For this part, I was thinking of using
beads and paint to create a plaid pattern.

00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:50.208
For example, like the
lines on this patchwork...

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.292
Let me give you an example, like...

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:58.042
(P Mode Fashion College)

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.333
Professor Nakano.

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:24.750
I'm sorry
to always bother you on your break.

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:28.292
It's fine. So, is it finished?

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:31.167
Yes.

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:50.833
Hmm.

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.625
I think it's very good.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.375
Huh? Really?

00:13:57.875 --> 00:14:03.708
Enaga's bold, innovative style
and Sumiura's delicate, refined touch...

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:05.375
are both well-represented.

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.417
I can feel the connection between you two.

00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:18.375
If you just refine the details
and the silhouette a bit more,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.292
I think you can start production.

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:22.833
Thank you, Professor.

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:25.750
Thank you very much.

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:27.458
Let's go.

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:42.083
Okay, where should we start?

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:47.208
First, let's go find a pattern
in the resource room.

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:52.417
As for inspiration... How about we go to
the zoo or an exhibition over the break?

00:14:52.542 --> 00:14:54.917
We can observe the structures
and lines of living things...

00:14:55.042 --> 00:14:58.083
I have to tell him... about AE.

00:14:58.208 --> 00:14:59.583
Sumiura.

00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:05.625
Ah, your shoelace is untied.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.667
Oh! Thanks.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:14.125
If I'm going to say it... it has to be now.

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:17.292
Ah, it's tangled.

00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:20.625
You're so clumsy.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.292
What would you do without me?

00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:24.875
I'm trying my best.

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:32.708
- Sumiura, I...
- You know,

00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:37.042
I'm taking this competition very seriously.

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.917
It's for personal reasons,

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:45.500
but I'll probably pour more of myself
into this than for my graduation project.

00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:47.875
Personal reasons?

00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:53.208
I can't go into the details. We don't
know each other that well yet, Enaga.

00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:58.708
(The way he talks is so cute.)

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:02.375
(But... this competition...)

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.000
(Is it really that important to Chiaki?)

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:08.208
Okay.

00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.125
Let's go.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.333
Yeah.

00:16:11.583 --> 00:16:13.943
By the way, Enaga, were you
about to say something earlier?

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.625
(If I tell him right now that I'm AE, )

00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:24.708
(whether Chiaki forgives
me or gets angry, )

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:28.167
(he won't be able to focus on his work.)

00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:33.875
No, just that the competition
is only two months away.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.417
We have to make every second count.

00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:40.417
Yeah!

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.750
Let's make sure we win this competition.

00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:49.208
(Right. Telling Chiaki the truth now...)

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:51.417
(...would just be for my own convenience.)

00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:54.292
(Until this competition is over, )

00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:58.833
(I'll just keep being
Enaga Ayumu around him.)

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:08.375
The tighter the lines are here...

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.125
the cuter it ends up looking, right?

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.708
True, but that makes
the silhouette stand out.

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:14.750
So the pants become crucial.

00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:16.833
Exactly. What are we
deciding on for the pants?

00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.038
For the pants, I'm thinking
of a flared cut for now.

00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:21.083
How would that work
with the jacket's style?

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:23.226
If we do that, I feel like we'll stray
from the punk vibe we're going for.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.208
We can add some beading as an accent
to bring back that punk feel.

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:28.833
- 80.
- Okay.

00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:29.750
80.

00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:30.625
91.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.875
91.

00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.476
For the vest color, are we sticking
with the black we talked about?

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.351
- Yeah, I think that works.
- What kind of fabric do you think we should use?

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:41.000
I want it to look... a little
more glamorous on the runway.

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:42.667
Glamorous... like this?

00:17:42.792 --> 00:17:43.667
Oh, that's nice.

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:44.583
Isn't it a bit... frumpy?

00:17:44.708 --> 00:17:46.375
Would a matte finish be better?

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.059
- This could work.
- A matte finish, then?

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:48.792
Yeah.

00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:50.833
The left and right sides are different.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.540
How many centimeters? Two?

00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:54.208
Here, take a look.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.208
Huh? I forgot.

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:57.625
Focus!

00:18:01.917 --> 00:18:05.292
Maybe we could make them into shorts?

00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:07.458
Shorts would be great.

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:10.667
Shorts, and we'll add the beading here.

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:13.417
(Sumiura Residence, No. 13)

00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:52.708
Right now, just focus on the competition.

00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:56.292
Focus!

00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:59.458
Focus...

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.789
- Ah!
- Hey!

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.299
You messed it up.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.710
It's already cut.

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:19.689
Use this side and do it again.

00:19:20.229 --> 00:19:21.229
Okay.

00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:23.573
Have you practiced?

00:19:23.573 --> 00:19:24.859
Yes, I've practiced.

00:19:25.719 --> 00:19:28.080
Align it here again.
Cut it straight.

00:19:31.949 --> 00:19:33.349
Yes! Yes!

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.410
Then from here, cut over to there.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.170
Stop here.

00:19:39.209 --> 00:19:40.209
Not bad.

00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:29.417
We're never going to finish...

00:20:31.292 --> 00:20:33.625
At this rate, we won't make it in time.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.583
What are we going to do?
The competition is next week.

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:38.708
This is a disaster.

00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:41.667
Hey, Enaga, try to look
a little more panicked!

00:20:44.292 --> 00:20:45.667
You guys are still here?

00:20:45.792 --> 00:20:49.042
The school's about to close. Hurry up.

00:20:54.167 --> 00:20:55.625
There's no other way.

00:20:56.583 --> 00:20:58.833
Enaga, you want to come over to my place?

00:20:58.958 --> 00:20:59.792
Are you sure?

00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:02.083
Yeah, let's do it. My place is closer.

00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:03.934
Besides, we have to
pull an all-nighter to finish.

00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:06.375
And I can't do it without your help.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.417
So you just want me for my hands?

00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:11.458
Hurry up and get your stuff.

00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:14.458
Let's go.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.458
Let me lean on your shoulder.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.292
He's so close.

00:21:44.917 --> 00:21:48.500
Chiaki, you're really different now.

00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:51.583
This is a side of you I never
saw when you were with AE.

00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:56.958
He can probably be
this natural around me...

00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:58.875
because he doesn't see me that way.

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:04.583
This feeling sucks...

00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:07.500
This is my place.

00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.042
Oh.

00:22:11.792 --> 00:22:15.875
You asked me about idols before,
remember?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.375
Sumiura, are you a fan of any idols?

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.750
Idols?

00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:25.500
Idols... Nah, not really.

00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:28.500
Oh? Okay.

00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:38.500
Actually, I am a fan of someone...

00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:44.208
Coming in.

00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:57.042
Enaga.

00:22:59.208 --> 00:23:02.917
The idol I'm a fan of... is AE.

00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:08.625
Wow...

00:23:18.208 --> 00:23:20.893
(Next Episode Preview) Getting too
involved with people is just exhausting.

00:23:20.917 --> 00:23:22.375
Those days were the absolute worst.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.292
Mom.

00:23:23.417 --> 00:23:26.167
I don't want to ruin what we have.

00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:28.042
But ever since we got closer...

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:29.500
This distance between us...

00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:30.684
Then we should just sleep together.

00:23:30.708 --> 00:23:32.708
Can I turn off the lights?

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:40.542
(Sumiura Chiaki on a Day Off)

00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:44.667
On my days off before I started clubbing,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.917
I would ride my beloved bike
and go shopping.

00:23:49.708 --> 00:23:53.250
I'm the kind of guy whose
bandages get called punk...

00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:55.875
but this bike is the complete opposite.

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:05.750
Then again, I wonder if a
punk-style bike even exists.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.250
All right, let's do this.
