What's this new business about?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.380
[He-Yu Clinic]
The branch of He-Yu Clinic in Tianqi

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.730
is officially open today!

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.430
It's a clinic.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.430
Let's head home.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.740
- I need to make your father dinner. - Let's go.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.290
Come.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.630
- Please check this out. - Let me have a look.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.660
We should've asked Su Changhe

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.540
to get us some shills.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.500
Tianqi City is both happening and prosperous.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.260
Why aren't these passersby

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.730
visiting our clinic?

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.660
It's probably because there are

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.690
way too many clinics here.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.500
Unlike a tavern,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.220
these people wouldn't

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.690
visit a newly opened clinic for fun.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.820
Once it's gained its reputation,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.060
many will come and seek our service.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.450
Yet it takes a very long time

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.100
to gain popularity.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.450
It took us a lot

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.220
to make that happen in Nan'an City.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.540
And now

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.890
we're all the way here

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.890
in Tianqi City.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.540
It's all right.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.450
Master.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.890
After this,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.110
we will build a clinic

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.850
in each of the Four Greatest Cities,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.820
including Tianqi City,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.940
Xueyue City,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.130
Wushuang City,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.260
and Muliang City.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.890
There'll be branches of He-Yu Clinic all over.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.980
With Medicine King Valley's name on it,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.780
I guarantee

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.610
we'll be the top clinic in the world.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.570
By then,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.820
even our founder

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.260
would rise from his ashes,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.410
laughing in delight.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.500
But the Medicine King Valley's creed

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.130
is to heal the sick.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.340
We save lives

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.890
without expecting money in return.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.410
Well,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.890
instead of laughing,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.820
he'd wake up furious.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.260
Master.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.820
If so,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.130
when I become King of Medicine,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.820
I'll change that rule.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.450
You want to be the King of Medicine?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.850
You sure are bolder than me.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.220
Master.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.290
Think about it.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.610
Senior Brother Xin

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.850
has no disciples.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.690
That makes me

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.940
the only heir

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.780
of Medicine King Valley.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.410
Well,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.010
naturally, I'll be King of Medicine.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.570
How ambitious of you!

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.980
As expected of Su Muyu's sister.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.940
Su Muyu.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.780
Your sister wants to become King of Medicine.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.010
Well,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.060
what will you be?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.010
When Zhaoyan becomes King of Medicine

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.450
and the clinic prospers,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.290
naturally, I'll be...

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.780
the boss.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.580
You really do go with the flow.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.050
Exactly.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.020
Yu.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.490
If you're the boss...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.900
Master.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.540
Who'll be

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.100
the boss's wife?

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.730
My goodness! You...

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.730
- You must've picked that up from Su Changhe! - Master!

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.810
I've caught you red-handed!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.540
- Master, you're mad because you're embarrassed! - Stop right there!

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.290
Help, Yu!

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.700
- Help! - Miss Bai is right.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.930
You've gone astray.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.220
Your master should

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.610
teach you a good lesson.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.810
Mr. Su.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.290
Watch your tongue!

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.810
Second Master Tu.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.850
Congratulations on the opening.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.050
Many thanks, Second Master Tu.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.540
Zhaoyan.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.540
Bring the gifts inside.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.490
Otherwise,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.340
Su Muyu might have them

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.340
returned.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.540
Yes, Master.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.980
You did us a big favor

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.140
by helping us rent this place.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.220
As for the gifts...

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.810
Well...

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.250
I'll take them inside now.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.020
That's my sister,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.810
Xiao Zhaoyan.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.460
Her surname's Xiao?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.540
That's an influential surname

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.050
here in Tianqi City.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.220
Zhaoyan's never been to Tianqi City.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.700
She's not of the royal line.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.370
Ah, I see.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.140
Second Master.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.100
Well,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.540
your steps are light

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.780
and your face pale.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.660
How about

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.410
I take your pulse?

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.410
You're our first customer,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.980
so no consultation fee.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.540
Nonsense!

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.020
I'm perfectly healthy!

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.170
Is that so?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.930
Don't

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.660
your hands and feet

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.810
feel cold?

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.540
Especially at night

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.460
when your body is so cold, as if you're lying in ice.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.410
I practice Frost Qi.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.050
It's normal for my body to feel a bit cold.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.220
Then why the sweating hands and feet

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.930
and sleepless nights?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.780
Miss Bai.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.930
Please take a look.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.660
Miss Bai.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.050
Well,

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.810
are my days numbered?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.660
The root of Qi

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.020
lies in the kidneys.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.220
And it goes back there.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.340
It's said,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.810
"The kidneys draw in Qi.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.340
Your breath runs deep."

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.610
What... What does that mean?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.980
Second Master Tu.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.370
What my master means

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.490
is you have weak kidneys,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.610
and you need to replenish your Qi.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.370
Nonsense, Miss Bai!

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.100
You're talking nonsense!

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.370
All I do every day is listen to music.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.730
How could that weaken my kidneys?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.020
Do hear her out.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.050
When yang energy weakens down below,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.220
it causes cold stagnation.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.900
When yin energy weakens down below,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.140
it causes heat stagnation.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.140
I don't get it, Miss Bai.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.730
It means

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.370
there are two kinds of kidney deficiency,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.490
which are yin deficiency

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.660
and yang deficiency.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.340
Then which kind is mine?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.490
Both of them.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.900
I'm doomed.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.660
I shouldn't have rushed it

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.610
for the past two years.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.460
It's a minor illness.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.930
With Miss Bai around,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.020
you'll recover instantly.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.050
Well,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.930
who knew listening to music daily

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.700
could cause this kind of problem?

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.580
Who are you?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.410
I'm Su Changhe.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.810
You're the Patriarch of Blood River.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.730
Pardon me for my rudeness.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.580
I'm Tu Wan,
[*Wan as in late]

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.170
and I'm a friend of Master Su.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.410
What a nice name.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.540
Is

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.460
Master Tu Zao
[*Zao as in early]

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.780
your elder brother?

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.050
Indeed.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.540
Our late father used to urge us

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.490
to act fast when it comes to great deeds.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.660
So when my brother was born,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.900
he was named Tu Zao.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.370
My brother lived up to his name

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.410
and got famous at a young age.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.540
At just eleven,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.050
he killed a thug

00:07:59.160 --> 00:07:59.700
bullying our family.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.020
He then spent five years in prison.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.170
From then on,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.050
our father decided

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.810
it's better to succeed late than early.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.980
So when I was born,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.930
he named me Tu Wan.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.730
Interesting.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.410
Still, I didn't expect

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.370
the quiet and reserved

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.810
Master Su

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.250
to have friends everywhere.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.410
Do stay for lunch.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.610
It's all right.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.250
Things are busy at Thousand-Gold Tower,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.050
so I shouldn't stay for long.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.930
I'll take my leave first.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.220
Wait.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.820
Thank you, Miss Bai.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.460
Su, Patriarch, I'll excuse myself.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.850
Second Master, I'll see you out.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.130
Has he tried your cooking too?

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.180
Why'd he run the moment you invited him

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.130
to stay for lunch?

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.460
He must've recognized who you are

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.460
and got scared off.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.100
When I was an undertaker,

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.770
I felt delighted

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.730
when someone

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.490
became terrified

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.180
at the mention of my name.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.460
But now

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.730
I feel otherwise.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.940
Muyu.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.980
Does this mean

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.820
I'm becoming a good person?

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.130
Who said you were a bad one?

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.420
Miss Bai.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.770
She says that all the time.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.580
Well,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.460
I call you

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.460
a wicked thing.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.100
Oh, really?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.650
So I'm not even human now?

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.220
Hell Palm!

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.300
What are you trying to do?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.460
Your Hell Palm

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.940
is almost at its ninth level.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.130
Yes.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.730
It's almost there.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.980
It's nearly as strong as Mu Ciling back then.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.250
However,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.980
I need to find time for seclusion

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.060
and break through the ninth level soon.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.490
If not, with so many experts in Tianqi City,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.490
it'll be trouble.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.010
Su Muyu.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.700
I've always wondered

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.700
who is stronger.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.700
You or Su Changhe?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.890
Naturally,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.250
it's Yu.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.490
Really?

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.220
Who is the Patriarch here?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.340
Me or him?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.420
It's you.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.820
Then naturally, I'm stronger.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.420
As Master said,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.980
if it were a normal duel,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.980
I'd have a ninety percent chance of winning.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.580
But if it came down to life and death,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.010
Changhe's chance of winning

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.610
would be a hundred percent.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.060
Who was your master?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.890
I've never heard of her.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.490
Our master forbade us from mentioning her name.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.060
But it doesn't matter.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.370
What matters is what she said.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.340
I understand what she meant.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.130
She meant that Su Changhe

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.010
fights without holding back,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.580
while Su Muyu

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.300
is always merciful.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:45.940
That's why

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.700
Su Muyu's bound to die.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.100
Why?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.340
If there comes a day

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.100
when Su Muyu kills me with a single strike,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.700
it could be because

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.580
I can't bring myself to kill him, no?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.340
Didn't our master

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.460
say that too?

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.060
What did she say?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.180
That's not important.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.940
Today marks the opening of He-Yu Clinic,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.060
so I've got you a grand gift.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.370
Don't tell me it's another ancestral jade basin?

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.850
Calling us basins?

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.890
That's rather rude of you, Miss Bai.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.940
Master Mu.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.100
Miss Xuewei.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.340
You're here in Tianqi City too?

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.340
Xuewei was full of deadly poison.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.300
After it was purged,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.650
she went back to the Blood River for a few days of rest.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.890
Since she's fine now,

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.220
she's here to help you out.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.370
But I'm no longer the Poisonous Blossom.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.220
Can I still be of any use?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.250
I'd say probably not.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.220
Yet according to Qingyang,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.370
your mastery of formations

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.300
rivals your poisoning technique.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.060
Formations?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.530
I know nothing about them.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.060
Patriarch,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.370
you must've misheard me.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.370
I said I could set formations.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.460
Although

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.220
Xuewei has got rid of all the poisons,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:50.940
she

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.980
remains the foremost poison expert

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.820
in the Mu family.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.980
Her poisoning technique

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.220
and my formations

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.490
will make for

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.580
the perfect gift for Miss Bai.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.580
Therefore,

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.730
no matter what,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.100
Miss Xuewei

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.100
had to be here

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.940
with you,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.770
right?

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.530
The talented should work harder.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.250
Since we're not hiding our identities

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.580
throughout this trip,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.360
naturally, some preparations are needed

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.370
to make He-Yu Clinic

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.180
our base here.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.220
I promised

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.010
to gift Miss Bai a Spider's Nest.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.730
However, due to the tight schedule,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.250
I couldn't make that happen here.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.650
Still, we must do something.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.850
With Qingyang and Xuewei here,

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.100
setting up formations

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.730
shouldn't be an issue.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.180
This seems like a dangerous place to be.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.840
Nowhere feels safer

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.890
than Nan'an City.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.490
Dreams of the martial world

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.300
fade into the heart's stillness.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.180
The turmoil of the court

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.130
seems but a fleeting dream.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.730
Are you being sentimental again?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.700
The word sentimental

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.850
is used to describe a lovelorn couple.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.060
I'm just

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.300
missing my younger self.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.180
Aren't you a lovelorn man?

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.130
Then where did Ling Chen come from?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.730
And what about your Princess of Langya?

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.580
Well...

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.370
She has her own life to live.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.770
Right.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.180
She has her life,

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.300
and you have yours.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.890
You should forget her

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.940
and find yourself a new Princess of Langya.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.100
You know.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.530
It's all your fault.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.960
What does that have to do with me?

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.220
If Lei Mengsha hadn't fallen for you back then

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.250
and locked himself in the Sword Heart Tomb

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.220
for months on end,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.700
I wouldn't have gotten worried

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.460
and gone looking for him.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.610
And I wouldn't have

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.300
met her out in the martial world.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.650
Why don't you blame Emperor Tai'an

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.730
for giving birth to you, huh?

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.580
Everything happens for a reason.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.220
Anyway, by my guess,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.180
she should be arriving soon.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.730
She's coming to Tianqi City?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.890
A sword that flies without edge

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.250
only seeks reunion.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.130
She's really here.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.580
You invited her?

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.300
You finally had the courage to see her.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.380
I even dared face

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.180
Nanjue's mighty army.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.100
Why would I fear facing her?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.460
Are we

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.300
meeting the Blood River tomorrow?

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.770
Should we do it another day?

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.340
No need.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.980
Canceling this first meeting

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.420
would make us seem untrustworthy.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:34.980
You entertain them first.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:35.940
I'll join you after that.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.530
Sure.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.180
[Situ Xue]

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.420
The glow of sunset reflects on the lake's ripples.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.300
No small boat can cross it.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.610
Only the one in my dreams can.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.490
Your poetry

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.220
is even worse than it used to be,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.730
Your Highness.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.060
But I really did try my best

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.180
to dress just like I did back then.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.420
That's the difference between us.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.700
You try hard to look like before,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.770
but I am

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.580
still the same as before.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.580
No.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.730
You're more...

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.300
Stop.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.480
Don't you dare say I'm more beautiful now.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.180
That's a terrible line.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.890
I'm either in court

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.340
or on the battlefield these days.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.580
I rarely get the chance

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.980
to say such horrible lines.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.250
You still

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.460
have the Haoque Sword with you, no?

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.300
Like I said.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.490
If you were a mere swordsman,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.130
you could say such things all the time.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.300
My master once told me

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.060
that I'd only ever have one chance to choose.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.300
Well...

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.580
You can always choose again.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.940
Then can I

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.890
do so later?

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.420
Tell me.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.250
Why did you suddenly send me the missive

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.530
asking me to come to Tianqi City?

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.730
Something might happen

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.890
in Tianqi City soon.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.730
I thought

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.060
I'd ask for your help.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.610
I'm a wanderer,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.490
so I don't meddle in court affairs.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.220
I told you that years ago.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.730
If I could have helped you,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.770
I wouldn't have left you back then.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.220
I hate this place.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.620
And I hate being tied

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.810
to anything about it.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.290
But this time

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.730
I might die.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.940
It's like what happened then.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.290
When you and your brother

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.940
fought for the throne,

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.220
you could've died any time.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.460
Yet I never once came to Tianqi City

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.380
to see you.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.290
I know.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.380
It's just that,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.330
if I really am in danger,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.250
I hope

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.050
you'll take Ling Chen away.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.660
It's exhausting

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.570
to travel with a burden.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.730
You have so many friends.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.900
He has better options.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.700
He could go to Xueyue City

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.700
and persuade the greatest Baili Dongjun

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:10.660
to take him in.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.700
Or he could go to Sword Heart Tomb

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.530
and become the next Sword Deity.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.900
He could even join the Tang Clan.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.860
I remember when he was little,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.010
he loved tinkering

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.380
with bits and pieces.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.940
But you

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.290
are his mother after all.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.290
Does our blood tie

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.050
matter much?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.140
To me,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.180
it does.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.250
Forget it.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.050
If you die,

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.010
I'll get him out of Tianqi City.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.180
Remember my condition.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.980
Only when you die

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.810
will I take him.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.940
He won't avenge you.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.620
Like me,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.420
he'll be a carefree wanderer.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.940
That's perfect.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.010
How troublesome.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.530
I really regret listening to you

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.860
and coming to Tianqi City

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.620
to see you again.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.220
Miss.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.730
Who are you, scoundrel?

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.410
Do you have a death wish?

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.620
No... It hurts...

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.730
I just wanted to ask for directions.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.700
Where to?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.460
To the Sword Heart Tomb.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.810
So you knew

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.180
this is the entrance to Sword Heart Tomb?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.050
Looks like you're a guest here.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.620
What brings you here?

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.570
Are you seeking a sword?

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.660
No, I have my own sword here.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.770
My senior brother

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.660
came here on some business.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.010
It's been months,

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.700
but he hasn't returned.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.960
I grew worried,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.050
so I came to find him.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.250
May I take a look at your sword?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.050
I've never seen such a fine sword.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.180
I've never seen its like

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.140
even at Sword Heart Tomb.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.420
What's the name of this sword?

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:53.660
And where did you get it?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.700
It's called

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.250
Autumn Thunder.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.380
It's a family heirloom of mine.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.730
Autumn Thunder...

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.090
I've never heard of it.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.460
How skilled are you?

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.380
I'm decent enough.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.290
Draw your sword on me.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:10.730
Why?

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.220
Just do it.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:12.980
I'm not afraid.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:13.900
Come on.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.770
Golden Light Shield?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.250
You're from the Situ family?

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.940
You're pretty knowledgeable,

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.290
but you tend to dawdle.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.570
Do it already!

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.250
Sure!

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.810
Nice.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.010
What a fine sword.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.140
How strong its sword energy is.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.380
Miss!

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:13.380
♪When we meet again, may our first glance be as it was before♪

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:20.860
♪Ask not of joy or sorrow in this world, speak only of our heart's desire♪

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:27.860
♪Hear the free wind's song, hear the snow fall upon my battle robes…♪

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.530
Miss...

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.180
Are you all right?

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.160
That was a nice move.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.180
What's its name?

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.700
It's known as

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.460
The World's Third.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.730
That's an odd name.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.860
What does it mean?

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.770
My master once claimed that,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.220
when it comes to swordsmanship,

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.380
he is

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.490
second to none.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.380
I admit I'll never surpass him.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.860
So I created this technique

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.380
to rank just beneath my master.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.700
Hence, I named it The World's Third.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.810
Not bad.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.330
From now on, you'll be The World's Third.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.380
Your master will be The World's Second.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.250
And I

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.380
am The World's Number One!

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.490
Miss!

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.000
Your sword's mine now!

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.420
Come if you want it back!

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:12.770
Miss!

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.940
Take it back.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.250
You chased me for a whole day and night

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.330
over this stupid sword.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.330
Miss.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.940
This sword is my family heirloom.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.570
I really can't give it away.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.050
Once I get to the Sword Heart Tomb,

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.530
I'll get you a famous sword instead.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.250
What say you?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.010
Really?

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.090
You're not lying to me?

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.180
I am

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.620
a man of my word.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.050
Look at me.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.490
It's so hot.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.980
Yes, it's kind of warm.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.050
I'm going to cool myself off.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.420
Miss!

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.140
It's still hot.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.050
What should we do?

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.140
Well,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.180
I've cooled down now.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.900
I have an idea.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.730
Let's get married.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.140
You'll marry into my family

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.860
with the Autumn Thunder being your dowry.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.940
From now on,

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.330
what's yours is mine.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.570
Miss.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.180
Are you trying to make me a live-in son-in-law?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.860
Why?

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.810
Am I not pretty enough?

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.050
What's your name?

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.770
I'm Xiao Ruofeng.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.530
I'm Situ Xue.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.140
Oh, right.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.700
Why didn't you answer

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.050
my first question?

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.570
Am I

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.380
not pretty?

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.660
You're stunning.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.010
It's settled, then!

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.330
Father.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.940
I've brought my husband home.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.180
Stop right there.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.660
What took you so long?

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.250
After leaving the Sword Heart Tomb,

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.330
we went to Guiyun Manor

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.490
for the Liquor and Sword Gathering.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.220
And we even won first place.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.330
We then went to Mount Xingwang

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.440
and destroyed the Lianhuo Stronghold.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.810
After that, we traveled back to Mount Qilei

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.010
by home.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.940
That brat over there.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.090
Let me take a look

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.620
at that sword in your hand.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.050
Sure.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.220
Father.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:45.770
That's his dowry.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.700
It belongs to me and him.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.530
It's the Haoque Sword.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:54.980
What?

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.050
One of the ten legendary swords,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.570
the Haoque Sword?

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.490
It truly is a fine sword.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.090
However,

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.250
I'm afraid

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.770
none of us in this family

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.380
are able to wield it.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.290
Young man.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.290
What's your name?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.980
I am Xiao Ruofeng.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.530
As I thought.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.530
You're of the Xiao imperial line.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.490
Xue.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.860
Are you trying

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.810
to bring a prince home?

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.940
I don't blame you

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.330
for keeping that from me.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.700
After all, we met by chance

00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.530
in the martial world.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.940
It was only natural for you

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:01.810
to be cautious.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.050
But I'm a wanderer.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.140
And I hate everything about the court.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:07.940
So...

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.290
I won't accept

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.730
this sword.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.570
You're a prince,

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.700
yet you came to Mount Qilei every month.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.810
Don't you have better things to do?

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.240
[Tea]

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.860
Waiter.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:59.330
Miss?

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.440
A pot of Peach Blossom Liquor.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.050
Coming right up.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.290
Hold on.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.220
Sir?

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:08.980
Make it two pots.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.730
Right away.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.420
Please wait a moment.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.140
You might catch a chill.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.140
Would you put down this umbrella

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:00.730
and spend this winter day with me?

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.380
Sure.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.940
I hate the court and its power struggle,

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:17.860
but I don't hate you.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.050
What a nuisance.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.700
I'll be generous

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.420
and allow you to visit me often.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.220
But if you ever become one of those

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.250
scheming, power-hungry men

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.460
who have no sense of righteousness,

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.140
I'll stop being kind to you.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.490
Deal.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.660
You have one year.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.900
If you can stay in the martial world,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.090
then we'll roam the world together.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.380
But if you choose to return to the imperial city,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.570
then

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.460
we part ways for good.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.090
Neither of us will be happy again.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.340
This is Su Muyu, head of the Su family.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.010
I bet you all know him well.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.060
This

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.380
is Mu Qingyang, head of the Mu family.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.490
You must have met him many times, Guardian Azure Dragon.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.130
And this...

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:32.820
Of course,

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.420
she isn't the Xie family head.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.900
She's a dear friend and a sister in arms

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.740
of the Blood River.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.610
She's Bai Hehuai, a miracle physician

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.210
from Medicine King Valley.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.260
I'm Bai Hehuai of Medicine King Valley.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.860
Greetings, fellow Guardians.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.740
In terms of seniority,

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.650
you're the most senior

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.690
among us.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.900
So just spare the formalities.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.690
Master Xie.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.050
Why is Xie Qidao not here?

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.340
Someone needs to guard the main hall of Blood River.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.130
Uncle Qidao is both respected

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.380
and decisive.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.570
He'll stay there

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.650
to act as Patriarch.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.210
Where is Prince of Langya?

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.740
You seem impatient, Master Su.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.420
If we don't start soon,

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.690
the food will go cold.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.170
Let me offer you all a toast.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.420
His Highness didn't mean to be late.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.570
Something urgent just came up.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.460
If it's that urgent,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.300
it must concern the fate of the world.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.090
Then let's wait for him.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:40.900
Indeed.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.940
I'm sure it's not some romantic affair.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.420
It's understandable.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.610
Please.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.300
They're already at Fengxue Tower.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.900
Yet Prince of Langya hasn't shown up.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.610
Correct.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.940
It seems like Prince of Langya

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.130
doesn't intend to cooperate with them.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.380
Wait a little longer.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.010
Yes, sir.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.460
Report, General.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:08.490
The First Prince's guests

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.690
are entering Tianqi City.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.130
One of them are already at the manor.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.050
Who is it?

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.460
General Dian.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.050
It's been a while.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.780
The Blade Ghost of Nanjue?

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:23.340
Why?

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.070
[Xu Liuyun, Blade Ghost of Nanjue ]

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:24.900
I'm not welcome here?

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.260
Mr. Xu, since you came all the way here,

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.210
you deserve

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.980
a cup of tea.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.170
Why invite him?

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.740
Mr. Xu

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.650
is always into the way of martial arts.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.530
He's longed to witness the Heaven-Splitting Blade Technique.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.090
I invited him here

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.210
simply out of appreciation for his talent.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.650
There are no boundaries between nations.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:55.380
Just like how I admire

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.300
Ms Night Crow's medical skills.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.260
The Heaven-Splitting Blade Technique

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.690
was kept by Mr. Li of the Academy.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.780
He then gifted it

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.340
to Xiao Ruofeng,

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.260
who was the Ninth Prince then.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.380
When this is over,

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.090
Prince of Langya's treasures

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.570
will be mine.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.740
Uncle Ye.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.570
Don't just stand there.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.260
Looks like Prince of Langya

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.260
has made up his mind.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.170
If so, Muyu...

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:35.170
Let's go.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.530
Miss Bai.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.130
Looks like we won't have time

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.900
to make He-Yu Clinic famous in Tianqi.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.260
We're leaving tomorrow.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.420
Come.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.010
You can't go.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.260
Why?

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.340
Are you

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.260
going to take credit

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.530
for capturing us?

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.420
Tell me

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.690
how to undo the puppet spell.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.210
I have to save my senior brother.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.650
Lianyue.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.380
Calm yourself.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.570
Everyone.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.780
We indeed

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.530
have a favor to ask of you.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.650
Right now, the only one who can save Tang Linghuang

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.260
is Physician Bai from Medicine King Valley.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.530
We're being sincere here.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.610
You expect us to help just like that?

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.860
We already helped your clan once.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.260
Yet your clan

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.570
is more corrupt

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.570
than any heretical sect.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.090
Whether Tang Linghuang lives or dies,

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.340
what's it to us?

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:31.340
Move aside!

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.380
Stop!

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.530
So this is Blood River's ultimate art,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.340
the Hell Palm.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.530
It's certainly

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.740
extraordinary.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.420
Your Highness, you're late.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.130
What great state affair

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.900
kept you so long?

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.090
If you had told us about it,

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.010
we wouldn't have waited this long.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.820
We would've left anyway.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.690
It wasn't some state affair.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.420
Just a matter

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.010
of the heart.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.300
Then it was worth waiting for.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.570
It was worth it.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.820
Miss Bai,

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:30.980
what's wrong?

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.090
Nothing.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.210
Your Highness,

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.900
you seem a bit tired.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.010
Shall I write a prescription

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.420
to help regulate your health?

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.010
Thank you, Miss Bai.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.210
But there's no need for that.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.530
Everyone,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:46.650
please.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.530
So, friends of the Blood River,

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.490
what is it you wish to discuss with us?

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.260
Since Changhe

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.380
took over as our patriarch,

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.980
we've reorganized the Three Families,

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:03.980
leveled the Soul Reapers' Hall,

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.420
and cut off

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.380
Shadow Sect's interference.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.650
Now, we're

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.210
a purely martial sect.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:12.050
But after all those years,

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.090
we left the world

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.570
with too dark a legacy.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.570
It's not easy to step out

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.380
of the shadows.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.940
We had planned to work with the Tang Clan,

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.570
using their reputation

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.170
to clear obstacles for us.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.210
We had already

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.380
reached an agreement with Tang Linghuang.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.210
However, the Tang Clan fell into corruption.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.090
Tang Lingzun led a revolt

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.170
and ruined our plan.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.050
We helped them for nothing.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.010
Your Highness.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.420
Tell me, who's the righteous one

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.490
and who's the evil one here?

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.210
Well,

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.820
why didn't you go to Xueyue City?

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.420
It's the top sect

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.490
in the martial world today.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.210
Your Highness is insightful.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.010
If you ask me,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.340
we should just challenge them.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.050
Beat their three city lords

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.210
to a pulp.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.420
After that,

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.940
who'd care

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.820
what the world thinks?

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.570
We'd be number one!

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.650
Who are you planning to beat to a pulp?

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.090
Changhe.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:15.300
Stop talking.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:17.900
Fine.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.260
Go on.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.260
We

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.130
were born

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.610
as swords in others' hands.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:27.490
But now we refuse

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.380
to be anyone's pawn.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.340
Thus, Xueyue City

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.300
isn't the right choice.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.170
So

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:38.900
you ended up

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.610
choosing me.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.690
You're the foremost warrior of Beili

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:46.530
and the top man in court.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.820
Your brilliance

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:50.610
is enough

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.300
to light our path forward.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.530
You wish to use His Highness' name

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.860
to gain recognition for the Blood River?

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.340
You could say so.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.570
It's

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.610
a win-win situation.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.690
We'll rescue Tang Linghuang,

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.170
get rid of the the puppet poison in his body,

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:11.900
and eliminate Night Crow.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.740
As for the one behind her,

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.690
they're likely of the imperial line.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.490
We'll help Your Highness

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.900
wipe their power from the realm.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.780
That's our offer.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.690
We wonder

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.530
if it's enough for you.
