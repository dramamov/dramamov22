[DEAD END]

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.280
[Episode 7]

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.170
[Casablanca Karaoke Bar]

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.229
Where are the girls?

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.229
I paid for the service!

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.759
What, are we just supposed to drink
on a dry tab?

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.280
Sorry, sir.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.640
-I'm gonna smash up your shop!
-How long do we have to wait?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640
Can you get on with it already?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.400
Can you get on with it already?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.759
Yes.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.430
Mr. Hei, you're finally here.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.890
Well...

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.000
Hi, Mr. Hei.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.680
Come to my private room later.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.710
Let's have a drink.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.760
Never mind, Mr. Hei.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.680
We're not in a hurry.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
No rush. Let's go.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.400
No hurry.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.120
Hurry up.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.760
Hurry up.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.000
Who are they acting so big?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.800
I don't know him.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.520
I've never seen them before.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.470
699.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.630
700, 701.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.240
What are you doing there?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.560
Mr. Hei.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.910
Two cops came by earlier.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.960
They made me count numbers,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.910
from 1 to 1000.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.590
That's nothing.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.090
Seriously,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.200
why can't you do something else?

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.140
All of you are so...

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.079
So what?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.630
So clever, right?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.000
Clever?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.190
You look just like Leon Lai.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.910
Not exactly!

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.310
Bro.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.310
I think you look...

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.710
Just like Leslie Cheung.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.079
Leslie Cheung.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.520
I'm being serious.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.960
We really want to change careers.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.560
Help me plan my life.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.310
What do you think I'm suited for?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.040
Just give him

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.630
our contact info.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.079
We'll keep in touch.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960
Pass the pen.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.680
Come on.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.960
-Write it here.
-Write down on my hand.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.150
Let's stay in touch.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.080
Write here.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.370
Write it right here.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.870
Little Erhei.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.720
You're getting quite bold these days.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.430
Isn't this Ran?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.190
Brother.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.030
What brings you here?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.430
Just came to support you.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.030
How many years has it been?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.960
You were so young back then.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.760
That's right.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.920
Back then...

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.890
You were just a little kid.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.250
We all have to improve, right?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.560
When Rémy Martin is opened,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.280
good things naturally follow.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.190
Let me toast you.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.450
I'll pass on the drink.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.000
I'm not used to that stuff.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.280
The girls can keep you company.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.540
What do I need them for?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.210
I'm here for you.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.400
No problem.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.560
What about them?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.730
Let them leave.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.670
Do you know how to sing this song?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.160
What are you talking about, bro?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.120
I know this best.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.870
The one who can't let go of you is me.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.430
The one who can't live without you is me.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.920
The one who thinks of you

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.159
is me.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.920
I'm the one who cares about you.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.600
I'm the one who can't forget you.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.310
I'm the one
who can't get enough of staring at you.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.630
The one who's considerate to you,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.800
the one who cares for you,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.310
is me all along.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.920
Stop.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.070
Do you think it's him?

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.430
Not sure.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.250
Let's listen more.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.830
Well,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.040
bro,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.160
w-what do you mean?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.840
Sing it again.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.390
C-continue from before?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.850
No music. Sing a cappella.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.360
What are you trying to do?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.920
This isn't right.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.720
I just want to hear you sing this.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.720
Perhaps in our last life,
the debt of love I owed you was too great.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.750
Is it him?

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.970
Too low.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.390
Even if you give me a...

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.990
Hold the microphone higher.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.040
Perhaps...

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.630
No,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.100
it's tuned too low.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.190
Tune it higher.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.270
Perhaps in our last life,
the debt of love I owed you was too great.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.950
I owe you far too much.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.800
Being a boss these days

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.860
isn't easy either.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.040
He's got to be
good with both pen and sword,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.300
and have some talents.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.600
But I think Officer Zhao
is really handsome,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.060
even Mr. Hei is blown away.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.920
Even if you give me

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.390
a bright spring day,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.040
I still won't feel like I have flowers.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.630
I...

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.870
Sing it again.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.250
Listen to this.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.120
I can't leave...

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.870
Bro.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.120
Stop messing with me, will you?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.600
My voice is getting hoarse.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.460
I just want to mess with you today.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.860
What are you doing?

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.650
Who are you trying to mess with?

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.190
Little Erhei,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.230
you're trying to challenge me, aren't you?

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.680
Bro.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.200
You haven't left yet.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.360
I'd like to toast you.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.750
Bro,

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.000
I forgot to introduce myself earlier.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.860
My name is Lili.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.140
Come on.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.510
I forgot you don't drink.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.560
I'll drink it myself then.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.240
No need.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.880
Don't drink anymore.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.720
Leave quickly if you finish.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.280
I'm singing for my brother.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.070
Okay,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.950
let's go then.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:51.480
Let's go.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.750
Go.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.390
Let's go.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.720
Got a lighter?

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.360
Here you are.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.160
Lili.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.490
-Forget it.
-Lili.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.560
Lili.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.560
Has the bill been paid?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.690
Why are you sneaking out to smoke here?

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.530
Not yet.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.810
Will you pay for me?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.750
Why should I pay for you?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.100
Don't you have someone
backing you up financially?

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.429
Isn't he your sponsor?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.000
I mean Little Erhei.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.059
Let him pay for you.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.679
Isn't he inside?

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.320
No, he is.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.610
Do you dare to go in?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.360
Why wouldn't I dare?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:42.909
So funny.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:43.909
Let me tell you.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:44.870
I've been looking for him everywhere,

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.400
you know?

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.600
What do you want with him?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.790
I'm going to beat him up.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.030
Give me a break.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.270
You wouldn't dare.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.870
He's really inside?

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.600
Yes.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.030
Well,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.000
how many people is he with?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.730
Who are they?

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.600
Just the usual crowd.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.730
You've met them all.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.960
Go home now.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.430
I'll come to you tonight.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960
I'm not joking this time.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.620
Leave here.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.490
Brother,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.840
just tell me straight.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.840
If I knew and didn't tell you,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.800
you could burn my place down.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.170
Have you seen this girl?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.870
No.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.270
I mean it.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.440
That Cadillac limo of yours

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.160
is quite impressive.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.320
Once young girls see it,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.180
they just throw themselves at it.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.550
What do you mean?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.890
What's going on?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.630
Fine.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600
You really don't know her?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.000
I...

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.320
Let's go.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:55.850
Brother!

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.400
Brother!

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.790
Let me take another look.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.590
Just one look.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.250
What happened to this girl?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.670
This isn't about that girl who died,
is it?

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.870
Got your memory back?

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.030
Your voice is better too.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.200
If you put it that way...

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.200
I'm not the only one with a Cadillac.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.380
Crazy Monk just bought one recently.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.150
Using me as a snitch, huh?

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.790
I swear I'm telling the truth, Brother.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.750
I only said

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.200
I wasn't the only one with a Cadillac.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.960
I didn't say anything else.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.560

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.670

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.270
That bastard is ruthless, you know?

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.320
When he snaps,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.390
he's capable of anything.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.590
Why else would they call him Crazy Monk?

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.630
I heard

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.080
he'd buried people.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.210
He even killed his own mother.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.120
Your big brother
doesn't look after you anymore?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.600
How old are you now?

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.650
My brother was executed long ago.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.150
Does Crazy Monk hang around this precinct?

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.410
He has been getting mixed up everywhere.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.080
The thing is,

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.200
he likes young girls.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.320
That's something

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.550
everyone knows.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.910
I prefer mature women.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:04.440
You know,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.640
with certain figure.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.000
But he likes those young girls

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.440
who are skinny as sticks.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.150
The one he's close with

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.750
looks like

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.670
she hasn't fully developed yet.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.670
Monk,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.500
I've figured everything out.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.670
Tonight he's got

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.450
just the usual people with him.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.750
His car is parked right at the entrance.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.630
Smash it!

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.830
Alright then.

No, thanks.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.360
Impossible.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.910
Who would dare fight here?

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:26.840
I'll kill them.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.880
Did you bring the money?

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.720
This isn't enough.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.830
I often smash up karaoke bars.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.960
I know how much it costs.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.640
That's enough.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.240
There's still a night's revenue.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.970
You disrupted their business.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.150
It's perfectly reasonable.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.750
Move!

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.680
First,

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.670
from now on, whatever you do,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.310
you must obey the law.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.160
Second,

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.880
regarding today's incident,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.920
both parties share responsibility.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.320
So we'll leave it at that.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.680
Third...

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.280
You've arrived.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.200
Thank you for doing this for my sake.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.560
Guys, late-night snack at the usual place.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.720
Great!

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.880
It's on you, okay?

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.510
I'm fine.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.510
I got top marks in combat training.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.480
Yeah, right!

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.270
If they beat you up,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.410
everyone at the station
would have to work overtime.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.110
Ran, you're leaving.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.690
I'm hungry. I'll go grab a bite.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.730
Isn't this a surveillance camera?

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.180
Mentor.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.440
That's a projector.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.550
No need to help me.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.900
Let's go check over there.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:37.180
[2012]

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.780
That camera should have recorded it.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.270
We're from the police station.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.200
We need to
check your surveillance footage.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.070
I'm sorry.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.370
Our surveillance system

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:57.830
is temporarily unavailable.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.400
Why?

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.790
The cameras weren't turned on.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.310
According to
the People's Republic of China

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.830
Security Service Management Regulations,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.880
the commercial property management

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.550
is required to retain surveillance footage

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.880
for a minimum of 30 days.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.660
What if we don't have them?

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.440
Penalties

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.510
and license revocation.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.770
Get someone in charge.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.090
Mr. Hei, someone's here to see you.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.480
Who is it?

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.530
Well, it's really him.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.270
Oh, it's you two.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.720
Little Erhei.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.310
You're

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.000
playing quite the elaborate game.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:44.960
[May 03, 2012]

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.360
Let me be honest with you.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.160
This girl

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.510
is just a hostess here

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.030
who accompanies clients for drinks.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.640
She insisted some creep was following her

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.070
and demanded to call the police.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.070
After I found out,

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.750
I asked her

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.790
what would she say

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.270
if the police

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.400
asked about her job,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.960
and who was she drinking with.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.720
If she tells them everything,

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.030
who would dare hire her again?

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.030
When she heard that,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:03.760
she froze up.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.070
She definitely wouldn't dare

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.600
answer your calls anymore.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.400
So are you

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.510
going to let us see the footage or not?

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.590
You can see the footage,

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.270
but

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.520
you can only locate the suspect.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.550
You can't identify our clients.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.110
Hurry up.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.920
[May 03, 2012]

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.650
There she is.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.960
She was coming out.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.310
She was going that way.

[May 03, 2012]

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.310
Well, we'd better not watch this.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.030
This is just

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.160
my normal work routine.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.360

Which one?

I've got it all figured out.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.130
He's not from the Division Two.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.370
He's from Nanhuaishu Police Station.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.090
Just a precinct cop.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.310
What should we do?

Shall we teach him a lesson?

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.720
Don't you know a guy
who sells Forever bicycles?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.520
And Phoenix bikes are also okay.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.770
Order a dozen new bikes

Yeah, Monk.

You're giving him bikes?

He should be giving you the bikes.

That's right.

the company handling demolition

we only met Crazy Monk once,

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.460

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.490
A police officer from the local station.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.920
Officer,

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.840
what business do you have with him?

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.440
Take him in for questioning.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.890
I was just teasing you a little bit.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.630
I recognize you now.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.360
Aren't you one of Little Erhei's men?

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.230
Remember him?

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.630
That day at the nightclub,

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.000
this bastard can really fight.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:35.630
That's him.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:36.840
And now you're here playing cop?

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.230
You're the one who beat me up last time.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.960
Don't get physical.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.480
Call me James Bond!

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.400
So what if I do?

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.040
What's up?

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.440
What's wrong with pushing you?

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.820
Let go of him!

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.270
What's going on here?

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:15.280
Alright.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:30.840
My mom didn't allow me to drink.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.550
I told her

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.520
not to bother me when I'm drinking,

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.840
but she insisted on grabbing my glass.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:38.190
I gave her a heavy over-shoulder throw

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.790
and tossed her to the ground.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:41.920
Since then,

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.230
she never again
tried to stop me from drinking.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.430
Interesting, right?

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.000
Not at all.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.550
I...

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.590
I used to sell fruit.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.430
There was a crippled man.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:00.190
He showed me his disability card
and begged for some every day.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:01.450
I always gave him some.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:04.290
He called me a fool.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.000
I had no choice.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.760
I felt sorry for him.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.630
Then one day, I really got fed up.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.410
I snatched up a knife in an instant.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.320
He said, "Come on, don't do this, bro!

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.380
Was it necessary?"

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.070
I just laid into him.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.760
Since then,

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.490
he called me brother every day.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:25.440
Interesting, isn't it?

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.000
Not at all.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:29.710
Either

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.070
you beat them into submission today,

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:36.400
or

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.970
you're not going anywhere.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.160
If you've got the guts, beat me to death.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.760
See who dares to throw the final punch

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.620
—that one gets the death penalty.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.550
You know,

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.520
those who truly earn respect

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.570
are already underground,

00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:59.920
just like my mother.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.330
Interesting, isn't it?

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.960
Not at all.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.910
But you're interesting.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:16.000
My Cadillac

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.260
needs to be stretched.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.360
It needs to be longer.
