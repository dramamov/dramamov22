Here.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.560
I'll get us a better ride next time.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.520
I'm sorry.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.760
I won't let it happen again.

That's all
the great Night Shanghai star's

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.760
giving me?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800
Take it or leave it.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.920
I'll take it.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.680
We're here.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.400
Let's go.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.200
Boss, about the medicine shipment
for Yamamoto…

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.800
I'll give him a call tonight.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.800
We'll coordinate then.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.080
What's wrong?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.880
Are you scared?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.040
No.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.000
A bug flew into my eye.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.560
Better?

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.320
Mm.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.600
Oh?

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.440
You're here, Musheng.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.840
Yue.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.680
Yao.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.880
Chairman Du.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.000
Captain Luo.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Well, well,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.720
Musheng sure has a way with women.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.640
Won over Ms. Rose herself.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.040
All thanks to you, Yao,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.160
for arranging our meeting.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.080
If it isn't the star of Night Shanghai.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.560
The Rose in daylight is even
more captivating than at night.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.920
Thanks for the compliment, Captain Luo.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.480
Let's start the feast.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.840
The wine's here!

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.480
Come on.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.500
Pour one out for the Boss.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.680
Here.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.440
Why is she everywhere?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.600
Ms. Rose is Musheng's friend.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.720
Friend,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.880
not wife.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.640
Well, well.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.360
Who's upset the princess

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.280
of the North City Chamber of Commerce?

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.360
Ms. Man Li's upset.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.840
This should be fun to watch.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520
Shut your trap.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.160
Here.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.560
Musheng,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.720
this first drink's for you.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.320
You saved my life.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.320
Yue,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.240
don't say that.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.520
You're making me embarrassed.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.760
Chairman Du,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.920
let me toast you.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.560
Thank you for looking after Musheng.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
Drink slowly.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.120
I'm fine.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.000
Some women can be so spoiled.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.840
Rose,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.600
here.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.680
A toast to you.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.200
I'm glad you came.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.000
Ms. Rose.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.520
Let me give you a toast.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.600
Oh, dear.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.280
Rose,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.440
your dress is soaked.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.240
Maybe

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.400
you should take care of that?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.680
I'll go freshen up.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.880
I'm sure

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.800
you didn't mean

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.360
to spill.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.800
You…

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.840
Give me a hand!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.480
Let's carry on.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.640
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.720
Bottoms up!

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.060
No one's leaving till we're all drunk.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.880
Keep going.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.440
Come on.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.960
What's up?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.640
We haven't decided the winner yet, right?

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.400
I'm afraid of you?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.120
Go on!

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.240
Yao, play him!

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.560
Come on.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.880
Hurry up!

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.520
Come on.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.080
Drink!

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.640
See?

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.280
You lost.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.800
Musheng's got skills.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.840
Luo Zhenyao can't keep up.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.160
Idiot.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.400
You sure you got this?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.840
Get up, you.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.040
Six.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.160
Six.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.440
Five!

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.200
Musheng lost.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.880
Come on. Drink!

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.720
You're not any better, Musheng.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.240
Chairman Du.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.720
Ms. Rose.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.840
Ms. Rose, Musheng's had
too much to drink.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.160
You should stay

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.120
and take care of him tonight.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.280
Of course.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.840
You really

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.040
don't miss a chance

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.120
to charm everyone, do you?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.800
You guys stay too.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.320
Play some mahjong.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.240
Loosen up a little.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.400
Musheng.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.920
Time to play some mahjong…

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.720
Come on. Hurry up!

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.520
Everything's ready.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.520
Come on. Let's play some mahjong.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.480
Let's play mahjong.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.620
We've been waiting for everyone
to gather for a game.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.960
I'll help you.
