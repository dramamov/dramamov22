SHOGI ASSOCIATION HEADQUARTERS

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.425
Are you authorized?

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.885
I'm a kishi.

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:32.303
-Sorry.
-Apologies.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.144
Well, a former kishi.

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:49.946
Long time no see, everyone.

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:51.239
Seigo Todou here.

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:58.121
I'm here today
to speak with Shoichi Yuuki.

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:01.583
The new chairman of
the Japan Shogi Association.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.085
Is he here?

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:13.553
I assume you've all heard of Asuka Kunimi.

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.972
She's been winning matches against kishi,

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:19.392
and defeated Hayami joryu 3-dan,
in the last tournament.

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:23.188
She only needs another win
to qualify for the kishi admission test.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.607
-Call security.
-Okay.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.153
I'm not here to punch Yuuki again.

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:32.655
Mr. Todou, this is not appropriate.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:37.827
I just came to ask why Asuka Kunimi
isn't allowed into tournaments.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.999
So you know, huh?

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:45.126
Then tell me.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.715
Hey! Anyone care to explain?

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:52.717
That's him.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.053
Come with us.

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:56.846
Hands off! I won't do anything.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.764
Calm down!

00:01:57.847 --> 00:02:00.016
Get off me! I'm calm!

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:06.814
Being violent again?

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.067
Let Asuka Kunimi compete!

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.360
Please leave.

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:13.696
Are you all her puppets, or what?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.283
Why're you interfering when
the very first female kishi is emerging?

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.203
Don't you have any pride
as a shogi player?

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:29.045
I'm just playing the best move.

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:32.757
And I'm no longer a shogi player.

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.509
Take him out.

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:35.426
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.053
-Come on.
-This way.

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.138
Don't think you can get away.

00:02:39.222 --> 00:02:42.016
Asuka Kunimi hasn't resigned yet.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.851
You haven't defeated her yet!

00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:45.478
Get your hands off me!

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.874
Are you okay like that?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.545
Sure. I could put them closer
so they'd topple cleaner--

00:03:10.628 --> 00:03:12.380
I'm not talking about the dominoes.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:13.589
What?

00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:17.176
You've been banned from tournaments,
right?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.302
Aren't you anxious?

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:21.472
Well yeah, but…

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:25.685
It's not like I can do anything
to change the situation.

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:29.564
Yes, that's true.

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:33.401
Mr. Todou's helping me get permission
to enter the tournaments, so…

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:36.070
Right.

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:44.787
KING

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.086
I will beat him.

00:03:58.843 --> 00:04:00.386
Hey, let's go.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.596
Aw, man.

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.639
To where? What about the association?

00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:06.059
They're a bunch of idiots.
Totally useless.

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:10.355
But that helped me figure it out.

00:04:12.023 --> 00:04:14.817
Use your rook in a cross.

00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:17.653
If the vertical is blocked, go horizontal.

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.530
Let's go play some shogi.

00:04:23.993 --> 00:04:25.912
Hey, where are you going?

00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:27.747
To play the next move.

00:04:39.592 --> 00:04:41.552
That went quite smoothly.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:43.638
Yes, very good.

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:48.142
Thank you for your hard work.

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:49.811
Thank you.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:51.396
-Shall we have lunch?
-Thank you.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:52.313
Yes, let's go.

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:53.981
Thank you, sir.

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:56.025
Oh, hi. Got a game today?

00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:59.278
Yes. I'm on lunch break.

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.909
Well, good luck.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:11.999
Perfect timing.

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:17.547
You will be the director
of the tournament operations.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.673
APPOINTMENT

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:19.966
What?

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:23.928
I'd like you to support the association
as a director from now on.

00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:29.475
Are you serious, Mom?

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:33.563
Here, you will call me
"Executive Director".

00:05:35.815 --> 00:05:36.983
Well…

00:05:37.817 --> 00:05:40.695
I'm counting on you, Director Yuuki.

00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:09.265
TESSAI ANDO

00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:18.024
It's been so long, Master Tessai.

00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:24.906
I apologize for all the trouble back then.

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:27.992
What are you doing here? You left shogi.

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:32.079
This is Asuka Kunimi.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.041
Shoichi Yuuki's daughter.

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:39.879
She's trying to become a kishi.

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:46.385
But the association is interfering,
banning her from tournaments.

00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:49.305
Master Tessai, could you please help--

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:50.514
Not my business.

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.308
Leave.

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:55.019
We've been long over.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.689
Besides, I'm not the chairman now.

00:06:58.773 --> 00:07:00.149
Master Tessai!

00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:02.360
She's strong.

00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:04.195
Not like other ordinary kishi.

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.240
She might even beat you.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.996
What are you saying?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.251
Wouldn’t you like to see
the very first female kishi?

00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:21.587
Asuka Kunimi has the potential.

00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:26.592
The disciple you once failed
to make a kishi is interfering.

00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:28.261
Kaori Yuuki.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.403
Oh, right. I remember now…

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:50.616
You were good at mind games.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.126
Play a game with me.

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:47.173
Beautiful sound.

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:53.846
Kaori Yuuki also used to
make that sound when she played.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.695
That's a beautiful sound you made.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:11.197
Staying back to practice, Kaori?

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.198
Yes.

00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:16.410
Just don't push yourself too hard.

00:09:16.494 --> 00:09:17.453
Master.

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:18.454
Yes?

00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:24.001
Is it true that
women can't become a kishi?

00:09:24.085 --> 00:09:25.211
What?

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.881
Well no, that's not--

00:09:28.964 --> 00:09:32.635
Is it true that women are weaker than men?

00:09:34.845 --> 00:09:35.930
I…

00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:40.434
I must become stronger, like my father.

00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:45.064
I'll become strong
and leave the Shoreikai.

00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:51.404
And I'll become a kishi.

00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:03.582
But…

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:09.255
If you focus only
on which moves to make in the future,

00:10:10.756 --> 00:10:14.301
you might have the rug
pulled out from under you.

00:10:14.885 --> 00:10:15.720
Have some.

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:56.218
I resign.

00:11:17.573 --> 00:11:19.158
I resign.

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:20.367
Thank you.

00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:49.438
I resign.

00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:03.369
Great, you're crying now.

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.496
That's why women are…

00:12:22.012 --> 00:12:25.015
Hi, Kaori. Tough day today, huh?

00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:30.271
But with your excellence,
you would dominate as a joryu kishi.

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:33.524
That'll be the best.

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:35.442
Spice up the shogi world.

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:37.987
Become a joryu.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.238
See you.

00:12:54.878 --> 00:12:56.797
-Hey, look.
-Oh, what?

00:12:58.048 --> 00:12:59.425
Whoa, hey.

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:00.801
-No way.
-Seriously?

00:13:00.884 --> 00:13:02.386
Come on…

00:13:04.388 --> 00:13:05.556
You're kidding me.

00:14:01.487 --> 00:14:02.821
I resign.

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:24.426
That's how much pressure
Kaori Yuuki put on herself.

00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:28.764
Yet, she still couldn't make it.

00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:43.070
ROOK

00:15:06.343 --> 00:15:09.221
You can tell how confident the move is

00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:10.264
from the sound.

00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:20.149
Want some?

00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:31.952
No thanks.

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:37.624
-Hey!
-I don't mind at all.

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:39.460
Sorry about her.

00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:47.259
So…

00:15:50.888 --> 00:15:56.310
Why do you want to become
the first female kishi?

00:16:00.064 --> 00:16:02.775
No woman has ever made it until now.

00:16:03.442 --> 00:16:05.152
It's a thorny path.

00:16:05.235 --> 00:16:06.236
And yet, you--

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.823
Are you already retired?

00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:11.283
-What?
-Hey!

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:16.121
That's right. I retired when I was 62.

00:16:16.955 --> 00:16:18.373
Sixty-two years old.

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.001
But…

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:25.547
you retired
because you couldn't win anymore.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.674
Hey, idiot!

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.057
I'm so sorry.

00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:45.400
Oh, I mean,

00:16:45.484 --> 00:16:47.444
it's just the same, isn't it?

00:16:47.528 --> 00:16:48.946
Your question earlier.

00:16:49.029 --> 00:16:50.072
What?

00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:54.201
Age? Gender?

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.996
None of that matters
when you sit at the board, does it?

00:17:13.387 --> 00:17:14.346
Yes.

00:17:16.014 --> 00:17:17.558
It doesn't matter.

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:33.657
I didn't ask the question
in the right way.

00:17:35.117 --> 00:17:39.872
Why do you want to become a kishi?

00:17:45.794 --> 00:17:48.839
To fight against this shitty world.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.363
Great sound.

00:18:16.992 --> 00:18:18.952
I resign.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.834
Don't ever change.

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:28.795
Stay true to yourself.

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:58.617
TATSUYA YUUKI C-CLASS STANDINGS

00:19:03.038 --> 00:19:04.164
Again…

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:07.167
I lost.

00:19:17.302 --> 00:19:18.637
Mom told me…

00:19:21.348 --> 00:19:23.558
to be the association's director.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.773
Apparently…

00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:34.486
the Yuuki family
doesn't need a joryu kishi

00:19:36.738 --> 00:19:38.282
or a C-Class player.

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:45.849
PRIVATE MATCH ROOM

00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:54.358
SINGLE-MINDED DEDICATION

00:21:05.744 --> 00:21:09.289
NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:31.686
I didn't realize.
Please excuse me for interrupting you.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.898
Your father…

00:21:37.651 --> 00:21:39.861
took very good care of me.

00:21:43.156 --> 00:21:47.035
I'm so honored you remember him.

00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:50.205
Good luck.

00:21:58.088 --> 00:21:59.381
I'm…

00:22:02.384 --> 00:22:04.344
I'm quitting shogi.

00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:11.143
I followed his words here.

00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:14.813
I tried to be strong.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.316
I solely focused on shogi…

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:22.320
leaving everything else behind.

00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:28.451
What else now?

00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:32.706
I have…

00:22:34.457 --> 00:22:36.626
nothing else to leave behind.

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:48.013
What could I have done…

00:22:51.391 --> 00:22:54.519
to be strong like you?

00:23:02.569 --> 00:23:03.987
I'm sorry.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.741
I'm just weak. That's all.

00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:15.290
I don't know…

00:23:18.001 --> 00:23:19.794
if you're really weak.

00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:31.890
But,

00:23:36.853 --> 00:23:38.188
I know that…

00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:43.235
I am weak too.

00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:53.995
I've been drawing strength
from Master Yuuki's words.

00:23:55.997 --> 00:23:57.916
That's why I'm in this room,

00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:02.420
facing the board for hours.

00:24:06.883 --> 00:24:08.969
In the eyes of people,

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.596
I was a villain.

00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:14.599
A monster.

00:24:16.017 --> 00:24:17.894
Heartless.

00:24:22.065 --> 00:24:24.985
After I found myself at my lowest point…

00:24:31.157 --> 00:24:35.036
I am finally…

00:24:37.998 --> 00:24:39.416
getting close.

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:45.213
I'm finally about
to grasp my own style in shogi.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.262
It is in my reach now.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.269
I don't want to lose it again.

00:25:12.657 --> 00:25:13.908
I still have…

00:25:16.077 --> 00:25:17.787
a long way to go.

00:25:45.982 --> 00:25:47.776
You're allowed into tournaments now!

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.487
I knew Master Tessai could make it happen.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.238
That's amazing!

00:25:52.864 --> 00:25:54.157
List of participants.

00:25:57.118 --> 00:26:00.372
-Seigo. Great job!
-Right.

00:26:00.955 --> 00:26:02.374
My plan worked.

00:26:12.717 --> 00:26:17.555
TOFU NEWSPAPER CUP FUSO TOURNAMENT

00:26:21.726 --> 00:26:23.770
WAITING ROOM

00:26:25.814 --> 00:26:28.149
Why are you in the tournament?

00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:38.535
I'm not your puppet.

00:26:39.786 --> 00:26:42.455
I live my life on my own terms.

00:26:46.709 --> 00:26:48.169
If you lose…

00:26:51.881 --> 00:26:53.216
you know what happens.

00:26:56.052 --> 00:26:57.554
I know.

00:26:58.972 --> 00:27:00.473
Executive Yuuki.

00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:24.080
-Chairman. Pleasure to see you.
-Hi there.

00:27:24.747 --> 00:27:26.666
Master Tessai told me about her.

00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:29.210
Asuka Kunimi, amateur.

00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:32.589
Sounds like she's in the spotlight.

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:36.134
Yes, she is.

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:55.153
If she wins, she can take
the kishi admission test?

00:27:55.236 --> 00:27:56.196
Yes.

00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:05.038
It is time for the first round.

00:28:05.121 --> 00:28:07.665
Asuka Kunimi, amateur versus
Tatsuya Yuuki, 6-dan.

00:28:07.749 --> 00:28:09.250
Please begin.

00:28:11.002 --> 00:28:12.212
Let's have a good game.

00:28:12.962 --> 00:28:14.088
Yes.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.741
Doesn't look like
he's going to make it easy.

00:28:42.742 --> 00:28:43.576
Really?

00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:11.980
Damn.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.692
Hey, why is he so strong?

00:29:16.317 --> 00:29:20.530
The opponents she's had so far
knew nothing about her.

00:29:20.613 --> 00:29:24.868
You can take measures if you know
the opponent's habits and favorite moves.

00:29:25.451 --> 00:29:29.581
That boy must've studied
Asuka's style closely.

00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:33.167
That's no good!

00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:38.965
Kunimi amateur, ten minutes remaining.

00:29:41.217 --> 00:29:43.011
That's a nasty setup.

00:29:43.094 --> 00:29:47.891
He's staying out of her territory,
while slowly dismantling her plans.

00:29:49.642 --> 00:29:50.894
This is bad.

00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:53.605
She's losing time.

00:30:14.542 --> 00:30:18.755
Well, what are you going to do?

00:30:44.197 --> 00:30:46.824
That guy. Is he doing that on purpose?

00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:49.619
Harassing her nonstop.

00:30:51.037 --> 00:30:52.163
What a jerk.

00:30:59.754 --> 00:31:02.298
Kunimi amateur, five minutes remaining.

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:24.612
I got it.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.430
Nice.

00:32:47.528 --> 00:32:49.197
Great sound.

00:34:26.544 --> 00:34:27.879
I resign.

00:34:36.137 --> 00:34:41.309
After 145 moves,
Asuka Kunimi amateur, wins.

00:34:48.065 --> 00:34:49.400
Yes!

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:51.527
Good!

00:35:01.037 --> 00:35:02.914
Quite the glutton she is.

00:35:04.081 --> 00:35:06.000
Don't you think so?

00:35:07.376 --> 00:35:08.753
Master.

00:35:09.587 --> 00:35:11.714
I'm not your apprentice anymore,

00:35:11.797 --> 00:35:14.550
yet you are still trying to
teach me something.

00:35:17.553 --> 00:35:18.971
Too bad.

00:35:19.555 --> 00:35:21.807
I still won't be eating daifuku.

00:35:30.233 --> 00:35:32.652
We're preparing for the next match.

00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:52.213
Your style was unlike anyone
I've ever played with.

00:35:53.714 --> 00:35:54.840
It was…

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.386
interesting.

00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:02.515
Still want to be a kishi?

00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:09.605
You'll have to face men
who are like monsters.

00:36:10.564 --> 00:36:11.565
You won't make it.

00:36:11.649 --> 00:36:12.817
Oh, I know.

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:16.404
A "wall that women can't overcome."

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:19.073
And…

00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:22.451
Dad is at the top.

00:36:22.535 --> 00:36:23.577
So what?

00:36:25.288 --> 00:36:27.164
If it's too high to climb…

00:36:28.582 --> 00:36:29.959
What, smash it?

00:36:30.626 --> 00:36:31.794
No.

00:36:54.567 --> 00:36:56.902
I'll use everyone as a stepping stone,

00:36:58.446 --> 00:36:59.822
and rise above.

00:37:21.344 --> 00:37:22.178
Thanks.

00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:23.220
I'll be back.

00:37:23.304 --> 00:37:25.681
Thank you so much. See you again.

00:37:25.765 --> 00:37:26.766
See you.

00:37:37.985 --> 00:37:41.113
You're Seigo Todou, right?

00:37:42.615 --> 00:37:43.449
Yes?

00:37:44.325 --> 00:37:46.327
Sorry to bother you.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.537
My name is Shibata.

00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:50.414
I write for the Weekly Bunka.

00:37:51.582 --> 00:37:52.416
What?

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.797
So, could I ask some questions
about Asuka Kunimi?

00:37:59.924 --> 00:38:04.220
Do you recognize
the person in this picture?

00:38:05.638 --> 00:38:10.142
Is everything written
in this article true?

00:38:14.271 --> 00:38:16.023
EXPELLED KISHI ATTEMPTED MURDER?

00:38:16.107 --> 00:38:17.733
PLANNED REVENGE ON SHOICHI YUUKI

00:38:17.817 --> 00:38:21.237
SCOOP! SECRET CHILD

00:38:39.422 --> 00:38:41.006
It's the biggest scandal ever.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.633
Why did you leak it?

00:38:42.716 --> 00:38:45.469
Because it's more fun that way.

00:38:45.553 --> 00:38:46.554
It's blowing up.

00:38:46.637 --> 00:38:50.599
If she wins three games,
she'll be the very first female kishi.

00:38:50.683 --> 00:38:52.017
Win all the games.

00:38:52.101 --> 00:38:54.228
That's the fastest way
to get to Shoichi Yuuki.

00:38:55.604 --> 00:38:56.564
Stop it!

00:38:56.647 --> 00:38:59.150
Apparently,
people call me a terrorist now.

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.109
It sucks. It's your fault.

00:39:00.192 --> 00:39:01.652
Kunimi amateur, lost two in a row.

00:39:01.735 --> 00:39:04.822
Another loss, and she'll be disqualified.

00:39:06.282 --> 00:39:07.116
I'm sorry.

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:08.242
