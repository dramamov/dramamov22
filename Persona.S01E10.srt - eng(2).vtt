Mengmeng.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.580
Mengmeng.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.140
Mengmeng.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.860
Mengmeng.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.980
Hello.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.740
Mengmeng has a fever.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.020
I'll take her to the hospital.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.550
Hurry over.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.830
How much do you family members
know about her condition?

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.510
We

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.140
don't know much.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.980
(Considering high possibility
of pancreatic cancer)

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.950
It's stage IV
pancreatic malignant tumor.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.860
(Recommend further examination)

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.230
So how is stage IV treated?

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.590
Basically just chemotherapy
plus immunotherapy.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.670
Probably lose both life and money.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.230
But it must be treated.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.740
We'll pay whatever it takes.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.420
I understand how you feel.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.380
But to be blunt,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.620
pancreatic cancer

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.820
is the king of cancers.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.790
The condition

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.180
has already progressed to the point

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
where the patient feels
this kind of pain.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.300
It'll only get worse later.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.910
If you insist on treatment,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.990
you need to talk it over with her first.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.550
But to be honest,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.420
it's not very meaningful.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.390
Doctor.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.790
Well...

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.670
what do you mean by

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.940
"not very meaningful"?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.590
To be conservative,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.590
three months to half a year.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.380
How is it? Still hurting?

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.030
Nothing much.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.860
It hurt a bit before.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.260
It's much better now.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.710
What's the illness?

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.180
- Doctor...
- Pancreatitis, right?

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.820
I looked it up before.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.670
It's pretty much
the same as my symptoms.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.860
It's nothing serious.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.740
Just go back and rest,
and it'll be fine.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.470
Hong.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.350
Tell him to stop this IV drip.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.820
Wait, let's finish the IV first.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.740
Let's go home first.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.580
Anyway,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.740
Mengmeng is at home with Danshun.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.180
Have you made up your mind?

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.470
Hospitalization?

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.230
I'll find you later.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.110
Thank you.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.030
No need for hospitalization.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.100
Isn't...

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.670
Isn't it pancreatitis?

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.990
Zhang Yan.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.790
The doctor said

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.110
you have stage IV pancreatic cancer.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.350
Can it be treated?

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.910
To be conservative,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.380
three months to half a year.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.230
Of course.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.030
It can definitely be cured.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.550
Medical science is so advanced now.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.380
Many cancers have been cured.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.060
Really?

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.550
Yeah.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.150
I can't be hospitalized.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.350
- Zhang Yan.
- I want to go home.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.550
Calm down.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.150
Mengmeng is waiting.
I want to go home.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.940
- Calm down.
- Hong, don't stop me.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.260
I can't be hospitalized.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.710
I want to go back.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.590
Calm down, finish the IV drip.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.060
Let's finish the IV drip.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.940
Calm down.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.940
I can't be hospitalized.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.030
I don't have that much time.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.180
Hong, let me go back.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.110
Alright, alright.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.310
No hospitalization.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.910
Mengmeng is still waiting for me.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.900
Okay.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.110
Hong.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.910
Don't tell Danshun yet.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.310
I want to find a time to
tell him myself.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.710
Alright.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.540

Mengmeng has a fever.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.720
I'll take her to the hospital.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.260
Hurry over.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.990
Does anyone in your family
take sleeping pills?

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.020
(First Aid Room)
The Lab Test Results came out.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.500
It shows high levels of
Diazepam in the blood.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.900
If the high fever persists

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.070
and it lasts for a long time,

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.590
it could cause brain damage.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.070
You need to prepare yourself
for the worst.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.110
This idea

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.190
should help her fall asleep, right?

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.050

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.350
I know what you're going to do.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.190
I have another way.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.990
After watching those videos,

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.070
you didn't even ask me what to do.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.430
I knew you already had an idea.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.260
Hong.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.990
I can't let you kill Ma Weicheng.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.740
Calm down and listen to me first.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.620
While watching the videos, I realized

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.950
the time and date on

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.380
Ma Weicheng's last video

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.860
was the day Mengmeng got brain damage.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.460
(Ma Weicheng Calling)

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:36.860
She has brain damage

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.260
- not because accidental intake.
- Hello.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.500
Mengmeng has a fever.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.710
I'll take her to the hospital.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.620
Hurry over.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.430
It was because Ma Weicheng fed her.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.950
Ma Weicheng used to lull her to sleep.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.470
I thought he was being nice to her.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.950
Mengmeng trusted him too.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.860
Now I realize

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.590
he's been feeding Mengmeng
sleeping pills all along.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.260
That's why
she got brain damage in the end.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.660
He ruined Mengmeng's whole life.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.860
Hong.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.380
Look, I'm already like this.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.830
I have a plan.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.900
I don't have much time left

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.500
in this world.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.990
I can entrust Mengmeng to
you and Danshun.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.590
I think this is the best choice.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.780
Don't talk nonsense.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.190
I disagree.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.710
When Mengmeng grows up,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.540
I hope she will be more like you.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.830
- Not like me.
- Don't talk nonsense.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.190
You know.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.380
There isn't that much time left.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.380
Why waste it on

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.260
such a scumbag?

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.350
You should be spending this time
with Mengmeng.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.950
Go back to Danshun.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.140
Is this scumbag worth it?

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.900
The only thing
I worry about in this plan

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.590
- is you suffering.
- I don't mind it.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.590
But is this person worth it?

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.740
Is he worth exchanging your life for?

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.900
I'm begging you.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.230
Here we go.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.190
Come on.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.470
Tomorrow

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.860
we'll send Hong off.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.950
Hong, hope you

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.780
will have a smooth and safe trip.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.590
After the storm comes the rainbow.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.710
Hong.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.140
Once you get through this,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.500
you won't have to
live in hiding anymore.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.780
We'll live openly in the sun.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.140
Come on, cheers.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.980
Cheers.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.620
I was just being petty before.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.780
Exactly.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.020
You two outsiders

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.470
came here without asking me for help.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.790
Sis.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.020
Let us know once you're settled.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.860
Zhang Yan and I will take Mengmeng
to visit you.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.500
I don't want auntie to leave.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.580
Mengmeng.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.430
Let's make an agreement
with auntie.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.230
When you grow up, we'll go visit her.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.070
Alright?

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.380
Danshun.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.110
After I leave,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.780
your most important task

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.390
is to take good care of
her and her child.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.710
The three of you living well

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.950
is more important than anything.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.470
Got it?

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.070
Don't worry, sis.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.990
I always said I'd protect you
when I grew up.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.540
But I never managed to do it.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.990
This time, I will.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.830
Also,

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.230
seeing you this time,
I really think you've grown up.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.100
You're a real man.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.540
So, it's time to change
those old bad habits.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.020
Remember,

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.190
promise me one thing

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.910
that no matter what happens,

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.060
you must not act on impulse.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:05.710
Okay?

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.420
Okay.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.020
Let's eat dumplings.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.540
They'll get cold soon.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:30.990
Here, sis.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.740
We can't tell Danshun.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.540
We both know his personality.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.580
You are the only one who can help me.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.500
Hong.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.990
I beg you.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.340
Danshun.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.190
Mengmeng is a bit sleepy.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.780
Take her down to sleep first.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
Alright, I'll come up later.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.300
Mengmeng.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.470
Time to sleep.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.620
Hong.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.420
Thank you.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.380
For what?

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.910
One more crazy ride with you.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.310
That's enough.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.470
I asked around.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.540
I never thought
this place would be empty.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.710
The price is also quite cheap.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.820
And it's convenient for me.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.990
At least I know this area well.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.990
This is where

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.820
Danshun and I met.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.990
Before coming, I tidied up a bit.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.630
From now on, this will be our base.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.340
So,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.580
what's your plan?

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.740
I think you should

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.870
use Lin Chang's identity to
get close to Ma Weicheng.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.780
Get him interested in you first.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.340
Because I thought it over.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.950
He has his own standards
when hunting for prey.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.220
Mr. Ma, go on back.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.070
Alright, take care.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.430
- Non-aggressive look.
- Go back.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.710
Okay, be careful not to slip.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.100
And weak personality.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.020
Easy for him to brainwash and control.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.580
Then let's tailor-make
a Lin Chang for him.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.390
So what does Lin Chang do?

(Tiantai'an Health Products)

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.430
How about my old trade?

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.710
Open a clothing store.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.620
Bro.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:50.230
Sorry.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.630
I just moved here.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.500
A new store just opened up ahead.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.060
I opened the Tian Cai

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.500
right next to his store.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.190
First,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.500
it lets him easily approach me.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.950
Second,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.820
if the cops check,
they'll find me right away.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.500
Okay.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.710
Let's do it as you said.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.540
My name is Lin Chang.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.630
Could I borrow

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.500
the rope for tying goods?
Do you have it?

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:17.710
Yes.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.910
Can you lend it to me?

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:20.780
Of course.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.430
Thank you.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.140
Thank you.

A couple of days ago,

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.950
I saw you were renovating here.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.190
Looks pretty good.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.820
Just a little touch-up

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.710
to the old decor.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.150
Thank you, bro.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.670
I wouldn't know what to do without you.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.540
Why thank me? This work

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.820
isn't something
a woman should handle alone.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.260
By the way, my name is Ma Weicheng.

Everyone calls me Mr. Ma.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.150
You can also call me Weicheng.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.190
Then I'll call you Weicheng.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.870
Come to me if you need anything later.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.710
Haven't you eaten yet?

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.430
Let me take you to get something.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.430
Is that appropriate?

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.990
What's inappropriate about it?

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.950
I know this area well.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.380
I haven't eaten either,
let's go.

I...

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.060
Then I'll go change my clothes.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.910
My clothes are wet.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.230
Okay.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.390
I'll wait for you.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.230
Thanks.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.420
Take care.

the Northern restaurant closest to us.

Judging from Ms. Lin's accent,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.990
a northerner, huh?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.260
Thank you.

I'm from Chencang.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:55.710
Then why'd you come

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.010
all the way here to open a store?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.820
I got divorced.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.930
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.190
Anyway, after the divorce,

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.500
I thought I had no home left.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.950
I just wanted to find

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.150
a place far away to start over.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.670
No friends here?

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.780
Came here alone?

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.990
Quite brave.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.500
How come no one helped you
move the store today?

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.070
Weicheng.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.540
To be honest,

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.870
you're the first person I've met

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.300
since coming here.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.430
And also my first friend.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.470
This meal today

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.710
is also the first proper meal

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.340
I've had since I came here.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.500
So,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740
thank you.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.950
I see you haven't eaten at all.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.580
Come on, eat.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.990
Is the food I ordered

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.100
not to your taste?

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:53.990
No, no.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:55.710
Thanks.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.710
Actually, before I came,

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.150
I had some takeout.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.670
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.580
Weicheng.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.060
I just saw you had been busy
for so long,

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.430
so I want to treat you to a meal.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.870
But,

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.430
I was afraid you wouldn't agree.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.580
So,

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.870
I've already paid the bill.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.870
You're too polite.

If you're full next time,

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.470
just tell me directly.

Don't wrong yourself like this.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.540
It's good to live for others,

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.910
but you need to live for yourself more.

No one's ever told me

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.910
that

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.910
I matter too.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:07.820
Thank you.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.300
Can I have your phone number?

why don't you come in for a while?

afraid of the dark.

I'm too timid?

coming here alone to open a store.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.580
That's already very brave.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.990
It's not really bravery.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.740
It's just...

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.500
being out of options.

if this store will make or lose money.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.990
Women love looking nice.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.230
Open a clothing store.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.910
Even if there's a loss,
it shouldn't be too much, right?

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.340
You women always say

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.060
there's always one

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.470
missing piece in your closet.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.670
Actually, men are the same.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.870
They always feel
they never earn enough money.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.230
The elderly always think
they don't live long enough.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.150
Human nature is to never be satisfied.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.020
So any business
that can satisfy human nature...

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.470
Weicheng,
you know a lot about human nature.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.430
It will never lose money.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.950
Then what do you think of me?

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.670
The power's back.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.060
The power's back.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.100
Weicheng, what did you just say?

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.830
I said

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.620
you

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.580
aren't suited for such heavy makeup.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.630
Why?

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.740
You don't like it?

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.870
I don't like you

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.230
trying too hard to please others.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.780
Being yourself is the most beautiful.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.950
How about this?

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.470
Much better.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.870
Do you think he's taken the bait?

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.200
Seducing him is a piece of cake.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.540
It's just that
I haven't had enough fun yet.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.430
We need to control the pace.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.260
Then

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.820
how about we give him the

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.020
"play hard to get" treatment?

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.630
A slap, then a sweet date.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.230
Keep him on the hook.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.260
Then we reel him in.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.020
Thanks for teaching me.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.510
Oh, by the way.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.870
That day's power outage

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.630
was not sudden.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.260
(Power Outage Notice)
Due to old equipment on Jiuchang Street,

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.950
continuous maintenance
will be carried out for three months.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.340
It is hereby scheduled each month

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.470
on the 11th from 10:00 to 12:00,

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.500
a two-hour power outage,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.500
for circuit maintenance.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.910
Hong.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.430
The God is helping us.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.780
Alright.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.380
(6 Change outfit, 7 Final Operation)

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.900
(December)

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.150
(Final Operation)
Then our final time

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.780
will be set on this day.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.230
Well, you

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.990
should put on makeup sometimes.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.540
So that

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.430
Danshun doesn't see
how haggard you look.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.540
I work in a cosmetics store,

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.390
but I never expected I'd

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.060
get a gift like this.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.500
Don't worry.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.580
In this great show,

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.540
we are both good actresses.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.790
Weicheng.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.580
I specially ordered
this clothes for you.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.990
I think it fits your style perfectly.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.230
- Take a look.
- Thank you.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.020
I really like it.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.430
It's big.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.100
Is it?

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.300
I think it's fine.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:27.860
It's big.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.340
Let me measure your size again.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.740
Why suddenly give me clothes?

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:43.310
Guess.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.780
No idea.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.340
Because you're a good person.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.710
In those uncles and aunties' eyes,

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.910
you're practically their savior.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.150
So I wanted to give you clothes.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:59.820
You're flattering me.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.260
There is a viewpoint.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.390
I don't know if you agree with it.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:08.390
What is it?

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.990
Actually, when a person gets old,

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.990
rather than scrimping and saving,

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.710
leaving money to the hospital,

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.260
it's better to

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.300
plan ahead

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.060
and do more maintenance.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.910
After all, you only live once.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.630
Health is priceless.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.710
Right?

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:31.990
Weicheng.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:34.950
What you say is truly philosophical.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.870
I just love listening to you talk.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.740
I'll fix it and bring it to you later.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.990
I don't take things for free.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.020
As a return favor,

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.580
could I

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.150
treat you to a meal?

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.500
A meal.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.380
(Tian Cai)

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:55.260
Sure.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:59.710
Can you drink sake?

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:01.580
I'm fine with anything.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.020
Take a look.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.430
I don't know much about it.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.270
How about this one?

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.900
(DASSAI 23: 1280 yuan)

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.460
Thank you.

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.830
Weicheng.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:25.630
Weicheng.

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:28.750
You took care of the food.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:29.750
I'll pay for the drinks.

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:32.790
No way.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.100
That's not how it works.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.620
That's so embarrassing.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.620
Thank you, Weicheng.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:39.750
I'll pay them all.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.350
Thank you.

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:49.790
Weicheng.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.470
This toast is to you.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.750
Thank you for
taking care of me these days.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.830
Honestly, I don't think I did anything.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.950
Maybe I just appreciate

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.060
you, Ms. Lin.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.580
Weicheng.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.220
Maybe you think it's nothing.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.220
But for me,

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:16.540
it's quite precious.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.580
Because I've never met anyone

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.220
who's been so kind to me.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.350
So,

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:25.700
thank you.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.100
Is that a volcano tattoo

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.100
on your wrist?

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.620
It's to cover that...

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.460
Yes.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:36.320
Just...

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.990
From some impulsive things I did before.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.790
Looks like you have your own story.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.100
Not a story.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:52.390
Just

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.830
a tough life.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.060
Weicheng, didn't I tell you

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.350
that I've been divorced?

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.870
I also lost my home.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.350
But actually,

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.350
I've never felt

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.750
that I ever truly had a home.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.270
My parents never liked me
when I was little.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.870
They all counted on

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.870
my brother to
take care of them in old age.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.580
To be honest, it's like

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.580
they never thought I'd live to grow up.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.140
Because

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:25.790
I have

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.870
congenital heart disease.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.430
Weicheng,
you won't look down on me, will you?

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.500
So,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.620
- Hard fate.
- I don't believe in fate.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.660
Then what do you believe in?

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.060
I believe in myself.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.310
It depends on whether you can seize

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:49.430
the chances god gives you.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.310
I wonder if you've read

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:54.270
Dale Carnegie?

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.460
Who?

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.580
A book, right?

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.540
Weicheng, sorry I...

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.020
- It's okay.
- I don't like reading.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.750
Mr. Carnegie said,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.220
"Everyone

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.540
may possess

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.950
abilities and opportunities
they are unaware of.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.430
Everyone may also be able to achieve

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.180
things they have never dreamed of."

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.660
This quote

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.620
is so profound.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:23.750
You're so insightful.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.380
Ms. Lin.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.500
Why did you come to Pingtan?

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.790
I like the sea.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.390
Good.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.500
I'll take you to see it.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.870
I've already seen the sea.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:45.790
But...

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.100
there's one place I really want to go.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.100
Where?

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.220
Haizi Cliff.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:53.660
I heard that

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:55.620
people go there to worship the Sea God.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.660
If the Sea God accepts your offering,

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.180
you can change your luck.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.220
I think I've heard of it.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.020
But now the road is closed,
so we can't go.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.670
Right.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.430
A developer was building

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:09.790
the seaside houses there before.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:10.700
Fenced off that area.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.540
Weicheng.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.830
How about we sneak over there now?

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:15.710
Now?

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.910
It's very cold at night.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.660
Are you kidding?

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.750
No, I'm not kidding.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:21.590
Really.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:23.750
Not kidding.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.180
Then you must be drunk.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.790
Wine doesn't make you drunk,
you get drunk.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.020
Come on, one more glass.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.540
I think you've something on your mind.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:44.790
What luck are you in such a hurry
to change?

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.100
I want to change my

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.140
love luck.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.580
I can't always be alone, right?

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.750
Right.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.230
I understand.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.700
Being hurt by
the closest family and loved ones

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:05.910
is a very sad thing.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.830
So you came to Pingtan

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:11.620
to escape.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.700
I think you're actually pretending.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.020
You pretend to be very happy,

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.990
like you're living well.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.470
But that's not the case.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.020
No one's ever

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:31.140
understood me like this before.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.180
Don't worry.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.980
With me,

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.310
you don't have to pretend.

00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.620
Thank you, Weicheng.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.790
It's really nice to meet you.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:09.910
I have something to do, so I'll leave.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.860
Are you okay?

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.910
It's alright.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.020
I will be right behind you.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.910
Luckily these shoes broke.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.470
Otherwise I couldn't have kept acting.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.660
I can barely hold it together.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.390
Back when I worked

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:40.540
in the cosmetics store,

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.700
I suffered a lot because of high heels.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.750
Never thought they'd come in handy here.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.790
You have no idea.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.310
His face at that time

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.430
was all twisted up.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.790
So satisfying to see.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.910
Why didn't I

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.180
think of that?

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.830
I actually fell for his tricks.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.350
Because you're kind-hearted.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.700
But I don't think that way anymore.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.790
We're both out of that hell.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.830
It's not too late, right?

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.100
(Message from Ma Weicheng)

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:28.700
He said he found a path into Haizi Cliff.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.390
Construction site stopped,
we can enter.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.750
We can't delay any longer.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.140
There's only one month left.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.270
Then you need to be prepared.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.990
You might have to
endure some grievances.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:48.790
Being beaten is very painful.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.430
So you must not resist.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.060
As long as you don't resist,

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.660
you can minimize the harm.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.500
It hurts a lot, right?

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.630
What's wrong?

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.180
Danshun.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.500
What's wrong?
