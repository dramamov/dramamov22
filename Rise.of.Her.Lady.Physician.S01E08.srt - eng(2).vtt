=My Body Is of No Use to the Morgue=

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.400
It tastes so bitter.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
Looks like it's the one
where I added Coptis.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.800
With such bitter medicine,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.080
why didn't Her Highness make a scene?

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480
What's going on?

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.660
(Imperial Kitchen)

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.720
(It's midnight.)

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.360
(What is she doing in the kitchen?)

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.040
(She didn't get punished after
delivering medicine to Her Highness.)

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.440
(Is it)

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.120
(because of the box in her hand?)

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.640
Your Highness.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.560
Everyone, leave.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.760
- Aye.
- Aye.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.920
Attendant Rong,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.520
what did you bring today?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.000
It's bitter!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.280
Miss Lan.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.720
Please.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.870
Your Highness,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.080
please take some medicine.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.350
If this goes on,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.200
your illness will become worse!

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.480
I won't drink it!

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.960
Pour it out right now!

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.280
Stop talking,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400
or I'll give you strokes

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.760
and kick you out of the palace!

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.680
Your Highness, mercy!

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.230
I'll pour it out.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.080
Your Highness.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.880
Wow!

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.920
These things suit my taste the most.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.160
Miss, wait a minute.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.720
What's wrong?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.960
Attendant Rong sent me here.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.440
She can't come in person today,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800
so she asked me to wait here for you.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.760
Attendant Rong knows that you love

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.160
the pastries from Laifeng Tower,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.960
so she asked someone to bring it back
from outside the palace

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.360
to express her gratitude.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.000
What do you mean?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.240
Please don't worry.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.400
Attendant Rong asked me
to wait here for you,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.520
which means she's told me everything.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.120
How could she tell others?

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.520
If people find out,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.000
we'll both be executed!

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.400
(Rong Zelan,)

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.480
(I knew you had secrets.)

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.880
We've all had a hard time

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.720
dealing with Her Highness.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.480
Thanks to you, we've managed

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.840
to resolve this matter.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.640
Please take the pastries.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.000
You need to tell Attendant Rong

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.560
we can't keep hiding the fact

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.880
that we've allowed Her Highness

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.400
to eat candles and paper

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.800
instead of taking medicine.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.320
This is just expedient.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.280
Ask her to quickly think of another way.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.240
Okay.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400
I'll definitely tell her.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.840
Thank you.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.520
(Rong Zelan,)

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.640
(you had this coming,)

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.400
(so don't blame me.)

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.920
Minister Wu!

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.000
Something's wrong!

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.400
I found that Rong Zelan

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.920
didn't administer medicine
to Her Highness

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.760
but poured out all of it

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.480
and even secretly allowed her
to eat those objects.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.440
For everyone's safety and well-being,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.040
please stop her, Minister Wu!

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.480
This is way out of line!

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.680
How dare she mess with Consort Li?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.760
Lord Wu, this is serious.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960
We must deal with it now.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.120
Your Majesty,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.200
Your Grace.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.240
Attendant Rong,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.160
you've performed well these days.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.440
Thank you, Your Grace.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.480
It is my duty to prepare medicine

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.880
and heal Her Highness.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.280
Come on, Jinyi.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.760
Your Grace, wait.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.800
Mother,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.440
it is too bitter.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.080
I don't want to drink it.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.720
Rong Zelan,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.760
why is Jinyi unwilling to
drink it again?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.160
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.120
well...

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.080
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.000
Minister Wu has

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.920
something to report.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.080
Let him in.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.600
Aye.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.640
Your Majesty,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.440
Your Grace.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.840
Minister Wu,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.280
why did you come here

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.920
in such a hurry?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.360
Your Majesty,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.080
I'm here for Her Highness's illness.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.040
These days, she's gotten better

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.720
after taking medicine.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.120
Thank you.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.560
Feng Yin,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.840
tell His Majesty and Her Grace

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.640
what you discovered.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.200
Greetings,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.160
Your Majesty,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.200
Your Grace.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.560
Your Majesty,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.960
Attendant Rong has been deceiving you.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720
Her Highness hasn't
truly taken her medicine.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.160
Is this true?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.440
Your Majesty, perhaps

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.480
Attendant Rong feared
she'd be punished because Her Highness

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.720
wouldn't take medicine,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.080
so she ordered the maid
to pour out the medicine

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.560
and even prepared
objects such as candles and paper

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.880
for Her Highness to eat every day.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.680
Lan.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.640
Your Majesty, mercy!

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.320
Attendant Rong did tell me
to pour the medicine into the flowerpot

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.200
and brought candles and paper every day
for Her Highness to eat.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.520
I didn't stop it.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.040
I deserve death!

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.800
Rong Zelan,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.920
how dare you harm the princess?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.600
Your Majesty,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.600
please hear me out.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.560
I did pour out the medicine,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.920
but I meant no harm to Her Highness.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.040
You lowly servant!

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.400
How dare you deceive me?

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.760
Minister Wu, quickly check the princess.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.560
If anything happens to her,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.240
none of you can get away with it!

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.700
Guards,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.560
drag this audacious, lowly servant out

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.200
and beat her to death!

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.920
Your Majesty, please allow me to explain!

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.040
Wait!

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.920
Your Majesty,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.840
perhaps that's not the entire truth.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.280
Why not let her finish?

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.870
Attendant Rong,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.040
how do you prove you meant

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.240
no harm to Her Highness?

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.200
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.960
Her Highness's pulse is steady.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.000
She's indeed getting better.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.270
How strange.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.560
Rong Zelan,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.840
what exactly did you give Her Highness?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.080
Rong Zelan,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.720
did you perform sorceries in the palace?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880
Your Majesty,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.720
Your Grace,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.280
I only gave Her Highness

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.680
these small pastries.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.100
(Imperial Kitchen)

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.400
My Lord,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.720
could you please help me

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.680
prepare some pastries every day

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.240
according to this recipe?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.440
It's inappropriate.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.840
Please help me.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.520
Alright then.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.100
Why is it you again?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.320
I won't take the medicine!

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440
Get out of here!

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.480
I don't want to see you!

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.840
Your Highness, I brought something fun.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.560
If you don't like it,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.880
I'll leave right away.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.200
Really?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.080
Then take it out and show me.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.760
Your Highness, do you want to see
a small trick?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.760
Three,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.960
two,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.000
one.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.360
Wow!

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.800
My favorite candles and paper!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280
So delicious!

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.240
How did you turn the medicine
into candles and paper?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240
Please tell me.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.160
It's a secret.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.800
You must keep the secret.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.080
Otherwise, it won't work anymore.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.110
Okay.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.080
Lan, do not tell anyone.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.440
Aye.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.000
So good.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.880
Your Majesty.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.480
This is a candle-shaped candy,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.320
and the paper

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600
is not real either

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.760
but glutinous rice paper.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.400
(How's that possible?)

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.000
Lord Wu,

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.440
you can check it.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.740
Your Majesty,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.360
it is indeed edible,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.280
non-toxic,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.360
and seemingly

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.320
of medicinal benefits.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.160
Your Majesty,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.000
Your Grace,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.000
I noticed that Her Highness's
face was sallow,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.240
her body emaciated,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.200
and she ate unusual things.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.880
This is a deficiency disorder

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.320
due to an innate weakness.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.440
Ordinary medicine
tends to be strong and harsh

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.000
and might hurt her spleen and stomach.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.000
Moreover, she refused to take medicine.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.760
Therefore, I decided

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.480
to use food therapy instead,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.760
making pastries
with the nourishing medicine.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.480
Then I asked the eunuch in the kitchen

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.120
to make them into candles and paper.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.680
I used food instead

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.200
to balance her inner energy.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.840
Your Majesty,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.520
she's just a medical attendant,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.640
yet she tampered with
the prescribed decoction

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.640
and offered common street food
to the noble princess.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.640
The Imperial Medicinal Canon mandates

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.080
that all medicines and food

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.440
must be tested for toxicity.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.200
She disregarded the regulations,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.280
delivered food to Her Highness
without the inspection of the bureau,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.680
and deceived His Majesty!

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.120
We have strict rules.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.360
If we make an exception,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.360
I fear evildoers may poison meals

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.160
and endanger the royal bloodline.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.880
Your Majesty,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.200
the Imperial Medical Bureau
is in charge of the medical affairs.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.560
No severe punishment for this defiance,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.400
no established rules in the palace.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.200
Please punish her severely!

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.480
Strip her medical registry

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.560
and cast her out

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.760
to uphold the regulations!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.400
Your Majesty,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.920
I may have violated the regulations,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.880
but I healed Her Highness.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.680
I beg for your mercy.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.720
Please don't expel me.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.400
Your Majesty,

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.360
although she violated the rules,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.880
she managed to cure Her Highness's
long illness with food therapy,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.280
showcasing her benevolence.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.200
Lord Feng is worried about

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.400
the foundation of the state.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.560
However, treatment requires adaptability.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.280
If we only cling to

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.480
rigid protocols when facing

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.440
puzzling maladies,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.720
our imperial lineage might be in danger.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.080
Your Majesty, I boldly ask you

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.240
to pardon her minor fault

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.200
in light of her merits.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.880
Thus, all imperial physicians
will exert their utmost effort

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.200
and use innovative approaches.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.120
It'll be a blessing for the royal family.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.000
Then what do you think

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.640
I should do about her?

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.520
Demote her and send her

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.600
to the Ji'an Office

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.560
to not only uphold the regulations

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.960
but also preserve
the compassion of a healer.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.760
If she truly reforms her ways and

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.720
performs exceptional deeds,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.200
she may also be promoted.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.840
Let it be done, then.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.880
Thanks for your mercy, Your Majesty!

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.360
Lord Song, thank you
for defending me today.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.040
It's a debt I can never repay.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.840
If you need me
for anything in the future,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.320
please ask freely.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.440
I ask nothing of you

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.160
but simply want to help you.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.160
If you don't believe me,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.040
just take it as

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.840
a favor in return for keeping

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.080
my secret.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.990
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.600
As long as your affairs
do not cross my interests,

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.560
I'll definitely keep your secret.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.000
Do you mean...

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.240
if I get in your way,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.840
you'll turn against me?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.920
Aren't you afraid that

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.280
I might drag you down to die with me?

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.080
If you wanted to,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.720
you wouldn't have helped me today.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.080
Forget it.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.800
Hope you don't

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.080
die in the Ji'an Office.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.480
I wonder if I can

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.400
see you again
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.800
Don't worry, Lord Song.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.240
The Ji'an Office
is essentially a morgue.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.440
My body is of no use to it.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.560
I will come back alive.
