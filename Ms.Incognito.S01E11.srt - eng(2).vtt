00:00:51.038 --> 00:00:54.638
I shouldn't have gone to Muchang from the start.

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:57.138
None of this would've happened then.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:00.672
I'll quit everything now.

00:01:06.072 --> 00:01:09.538
I'm sorry, Chairman.

00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:58.905
You want to give up everything and die now?

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:10.938
Chairman.

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:15.872
Chairman, you were alive all along?

Attorney Lee.

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:26.472
Did you know about this too?

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:28.138
Madam.

00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:33.972
What have you two... What on earth did you do!

00:02:33.972 --> 00:02:35.338
Explain yourselves.

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:36.972
Why don't you let go of me and talk?

00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:39.505

00:02:40.172 --> 00:02:41.638
Chairman.

00:02:41.638 --> 00:02:44.405
Have you been toying with me all this time?

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:45.938
Must've been fun, huh?

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:49.605
Had fun watching me fight for my life?

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.905
It wasn't that fun.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.638
So you knew everything?

00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:57.238
Do you even know

00:02:57.238 --> 00:03:00.905
how many people got hurt because of you?

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:02.572
So what?

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:08.472
You're broke, but still righteous, huh?

00:03:09.338 --> 00:03:12.405
Did you think changing your life was that easy?

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:15.772
You want to give up everything now?

What? Are you planning to die?

[Suicide Note]

Did Ga Seon Yeong write this too?

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:31.105
Madam, were you really trying to die?

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:33.038
Chairman.

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.372
No, I'm fine.

00:03:36.538 --> 00:03:39.705
When I pointed the gun at her head,
everything became clear.

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:41.605
Even if I die,

00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:44.972
Ga Seon Yeong wouldn't release Jeon Dong Min.

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:47.572
She'd pin all her crimes on me.

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:50.272
And make Jeon Dong Min look like an accomplice.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.038
Obviously.

00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:54.472
Now you're thinking like Seon Yeong.

Chairman.

00:03:57.672 --> 00:04:01.438
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:04.805
I'm a businessman.

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:08.338
I always need multiple
contingency plans to survive.

00:04:08.338 --> 00:04:10.672
You didn't even trust me?

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:14.772
I risked my life coming here

00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:23.672
Our relationship

00:04:23.672 --> 00:04:26.605
is strictly contractual.

Chairman.

00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:38.972
Not only leave my assets,

00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:44.505
but also pass the Gaseong Group
chairmanship to Kim Yeong Ran.

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:47.838
You're giving Madam
the Gaseong Group chair position too?

00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:52.205
That's the only way to use Gaseong Group's power.

Seon Yeong control everything?

I'm sorry.

00:05:02.938 --> 00:05:05.838
I need more time to consider.

00:05:08.938 --> 00:05:11.005
Chairman, are you alright?

00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:12.905
This won't do. Let me carry you.

00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:15.072
Come on, let's go.

00:05:33.705 --> 00:05:37.038
Chairman, hold on a little longer.

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.705
We're almost there.

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:06.838

00:06:56.772 --> 00:06:59.005
How is Chairman now?

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:02.605
As you can see, he doesn't have much time left.

What do we need to do to save Mr. Jeon Dong Min?

00:07:22.638 --> 00:07:25.472
This is the will personally amended by Chairman.

00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:28.572
Let's make it public during Ga Seon Woo's funeral.

00:07:31.672 --> 00:07:33.305
Before the shareholders' meeting?

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:36.672
By hiding in Muchang and killing the hitman,

00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:39.338
you've blown our plan to reveal all of

00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:41.805
Ga Seon Yeong's crimes, haven't you?

00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:45.405
Will revealing this really give us any leverage?

00:07:45.405 --> 00:07:49.072
At the very least, it'll help us clear

00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:51.772
Dong Min's name right away.

00:07:54.772 --> 00:07:56.605
But why on earth

00:07:57.572 --> 00:08:01.138
did Chairman deceive so many people?

00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:07.838
We'll have to change the plan.

00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:09.572
Change it? How?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.872

00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:18.805
The juicier the story,

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:22.572
the longer the press stays focused on our family.

00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:25.538
That would be shocking, indeed.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:28.172
I don't plan to die.

00:08:28.172 --> 00:08:29.172

What do you mean by that?

00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:34.405
This is the final gamble of my life.

00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:38.705
I need to see how it ends with my own eye
before I can die in peace.

00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:40.972
Make the preparations accordingly.

00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:45.672
We'll need a lot of preparation to fake a death.

In Korea, there's nothing money can't buy.

00:08:53.305 --> 00:08:56.372
Why are you even doing this, Attorney Lee?

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:58.738
Is it just for the success fee?

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:00.872
Of course.

00:09:00.872 --> 00:09:03.705
I'm being paid more than I could ever earn

00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:05.638
as a lawyer in a lifetime.

00:09:05.638 --> 00:09:07.538
Is that all there is to it?

00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:13.805
Chairman Ga was the one who helped me
when I was a poor student,

00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:16.672
he gave me scholarships.

00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:19.072
I'm repaying that debt now.

00:09:20.138 --> 00:09:22.272
Let me ask you instead.

00:09:22.272 --> 00:09:25.372
Why did you choose to get involved in this,
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran?

00:09:25.372 --> 00:09:26.705
You could die,

00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:29.505
or even end up killing someone else.

00:09:29.505 --> 00:09:32.472
Was it really just about the money?

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:40.905
At first, it was all about money.
But now, it's my revenge too.

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:42.938
I won't let her get away with using money

00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:45.772
and influence to frame innocent people.

00:09:45.772 --> 00:09:49.238
I'll expose everything
Ga Seon Yeong did through Gil Ho Se

00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:51.672
and make sure she pays for it.

00:09:51.672 --> 00:09:55.205
It's been a while
since we've been on the same page.

00:10:24.972 --> 00:10:28.438

What about these two?

00:10:48.838 --> 00:10:51.738
The article should've been published this morning.

00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:54.972

00:10:54.972 --> 00:10:57.872
Yes, don't worry.

00:10:57.872 --> 00:10:59.972
There shouldn't be any problems.

00:11:05.772 --> 00:11:07.405
Today's walk was really nice.

- Shh!

- Okay.
- That's right.

I'll look into this quietly,
so keep your mouth shut.

Kang Seong Tae, if this gets out.
I'll know it came from you, got it?

00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:19.572
Why are you so curious about that?

You two are dismissed as of today.

00:12:23.205 --> 00:12:24.838

Madam,

even if we're house staff,
firing us overnight like this

00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:33.338
is wrongful termination.

00:12:33.338 --> 00:12:35.472

I quit. I'm done.

00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:13.172
Are you really quitting?

00:13:13.172 --> 00:13:14.172
Yeah.

00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:15.205
We'll figure something out.

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:17.305
We've worked together so long.

I'm actually on my way to see him.

It's been harder than expected
to get a visitation.

Dong Min will be released soon.

00:41:10.772 --> 00:41:12.705
That was remarkably fast.

00:41:12.705 --> 00:41:16.372
Madam, I'm Lee Don.

00:41:18.338 --> 00:41:22.838
Now let's return the favor
to Ga Seon Yeong as she deserves.

00:41:22.838 --> 00:41:24.572
Let's do that.

00:41:37.205 --> 00:41:39.372
- Don.
- Yeah.

00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:42.138
Ah, though you already know each other,
I'll introduce properly.

00:41:42.138 --> 00:41:43.838
This is the heir of Gaseong Group,

00:41:43.838 --> 00:41:46.972
not a gold digger, but Madam Kim Yeong Ran.

00:41:49.805 --> 00:41:51.038
Seung Hee, sit down.

00:41:51.038 --> 00:41:52.672
Okay.

00:41:55.372 --> 00:41:58.705
I asked to meet you because I had
something important to deliver.

00:42:00.938 --> 00:42:02.905
What's this?

00:42:02.905 --> 00:42:05.605
Real name Gil Tae, alias Gil Ho Se.

00:42:05.605 --> 00:42:09.305
Autopsies confirm Gil Ho Se
is Ga Seon Woo's murderer.

00:42:09.305 --> 00:42:12.938
And there's testimony that

00:42:12.938 --> 00:42:15.438
he tried to kill me in Muchang.

00:42:15.438 --> 00:42:18.605
What exactly was the relationship
between Ga Seon Woo and Gil Ho Se?

00:42:18.605 --> 00:42:21.038
Not Ga Seon Woo, but Ga Seon Yeong.

00:42:21.738 --> 00:42:25.005
They met through the Cheongsan Prison
rehabilitation program.

00:42:25.005 --> 00:42:29.072
They developed a deep connection from then on.

00:42:29.072 --> 00:42:32.538
You're saying she killed her own brother?

00:42:32.538 --> 00:42:34.305
That's impossible.

00:42:34.305 --> 00:42:38.605
Such impossible things
happen frequently around here.

00:42:38.605 --> 00:42:43.538
Reporter Pyo, you should also get payback
from Ga Seon Yeong for what she did.

00:42:43.538 --> 00:42:47.005
But last time too,
all the articles got blocked from above.

00:42:47.005 --> 00:42:49.405
That absolutely won't happen this time.

00:42:49.405 --> 00:42:51.238
Don't worry.

00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:55.605
Wait a minute.

00:42:57.138 --> 00:43:00.205
It appears that Professor Ga Seon Yeong has been
meeting Gil Ho Se, whose real name is Gil Tae,

00:43:00.205 --> 00:43:03.172
a prisoner she met
through the rehabilitation program

00:43:03.172 --> 00:43:06.072
at Cheongsan Prison, until recently.

00:43:06.072 --> 00:43:07.672
So what?

00:43:07.672 --> 00:43:10.772
Gil Ho Se was also at the dock
where Vice President Ga Seon Woo died,

00:43:10.772 --> 00:43:13.505
yet no news or records mention it.

00:43:13.505 --> 00:43:15.372
Doesn't that seem suspicious?

00:43:15.372 --> 00:43:17.938
Ten days ago, he even attempted
to kill Kim Yeong Ran.

00:43:17.938 --> 00:43:21.638
We've secured all the witness
and victim testimonies from the scene.

00:43:21.638 --> 00:43:25.105
Senior, are you going to let this
exclusive story slip away?

00:43:26.472 --> 00:43:28.672
Let's do this.

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:29.705
Really?

00:43:29.705 --> 00:43:31.005
Release it.

00:43:31.005 --> 00:43:34.005
Reporting the truth is our mission, right?

00:43:37.338 --> 00:43:40.672
Senior! So should I really write the article?

00:43:45.772 --> 00:43:47.438
Professor.

00:43:50.805 --> 00:43:52.405
Professor Ga Seon Yeong.

00:43:52.405 --> 00:43:53.738
What brings you here?

00:43:53.738 --> 00:43:55.105
You know Gil Ho Se, right?

00:43:55.105 --> 00:43:58.838
On the day Mr. Ga Seon Woo died, the last person
he met was you, Ms. Ga Seon Yeong.

00:43:58.838 --> 00:44:01.438
We'll need your full cooperation
with the investigation.

00:44:01.438 --> 00:44:03.538
Wait a moment.

00:44:03.538 --> 00:44:07.738
That day, I was the one who met
Gil Ho Se, not Professor.

00:44:07.738 --> 00:44:09.338
What?

00:44:20.572 --> 00:44:23.405

I'm repaying it in full.

You're not, are you?

00:45:58.772 --> 00:46:01.805
It's dirty and despicable, really...

00:46:01.805 --> 00:46:05.238

Fine, I'll leave immediately.

00:46:12.638 --> 00:46:16.905
But I'm taking my severance pay with me.

00:46:16.905 --> 00:46:21.538
I worked my butt off in this house.

00:46:26.838 --> 00:46:29.005
But,

00:46:29.005 --> 00:46:34.205
I was trying to set everything
back to where it belonged.

I ordered Gil Ho Se to kill Kim Yeong Ran.

00:46:58.905 --> 00:47:01.572
You know abetment of murder
is treated as murder itself, right?

00:47:01.572 --> 00:47:03.238
Mr. Ham Hyeon Woo.

00:47:03.238 --> 00:47:05.405
You've worked as Secretary
to Ms. Ga Seon Yeong for a long time, right?

00:47:05.405 --> 00:47:09.205
Moreover, both Kim Yeong Ran and Baek Hye Ji
survived attempted murders.

00:47:09.205 --> 00:47:10.472
One count of murder,

00:47:10.472 --> 00:47:13.538
and two counts of attempted murder.

00:47:13.538 --> 00:47:17.338
You'll likely face at least ten years in prison.

00:47:17.338 --> 00:47:19.638
How much is Ga Seon Yeong offering?

00:47:19.638 --> 00:47:23.172
I'll remain silent until my lawyer arrives.

00:47:50.938 --> 00:47:53.805
It was definitely Chairman, right?

00:48:53.405 --> 00:48:55.072
Chairman.

00:48:55.905 --> 00:48:57.772
It's really you, right?

00:59:09.738 --> 00:59:11.005
You stay in Muchang.

00:59:11.005 --> 00:59:12.272
That's how you can help.

00:59:12.272 --> 00:59:14.572
Yeong Ran, contact me if you need anything.

00:59:14.572 --> 00:59:15.605
Anytime.

00:59:15.605 --> 00:59:18.338
You're the one who ordered the hit on
Ga Seon Woo and Kim Yeong Ran, right?

00:59:18.338 --> 00:59:21.272
I'll make it clear that you're nothing.

00:59:21.272 --> 00:59:23.405
You're finished now, Ga Seon Yeong.

00:59:23.405 --> 00:59:25.872
Now you need to give that guy an answer too.

00:59:25.872 --> 00:59:27.838
I'm not a good person, Dong Min.

00:59:27.838 --> 00:59:31.238
But to me, you are
the best person of all, Yeong Ran.
