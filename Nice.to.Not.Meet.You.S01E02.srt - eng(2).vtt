ACTOR HYEON-JUN,
SHOCKING RED CARPET MISHAP

00:01:25.274 --> 00:01:26.191
LIM HYEON-JUN'S RED UNDERWEAR DISASTER

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:31.405
THIS IS FUN!

00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:37.953
THIS IS EXCITING!

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:55.012
Stop watching this. Are you a pain-seeker?

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:56.680
Why are you torturing yourself like this?

00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:03.354
You're taking another one?

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.273
Are you still struggling?

00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:08.067
I was attacked in a restroom

00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:11.695
and humiliated at the awards ceremony,
so of course, I'm struggling.

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.322
I get that.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.534
But that woman wasn't even a terrorist.
Did you think she'd pull out a knife?

00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:19.370
Why did you even rush toward her?

00:02:19.453 --> 00:02:20.955
This is all because of Kang Pil-gu!

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:23.374
I deal with so many bad guys in the show

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.834
that it's hard to separate it
from real life!

00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:29.380
Still, you looked really cool
when you ran toward her,

00:02:29.463 --> 00:02:30.589
even though you took a tumble.

00:02:30.673 --> 00:02:33.467
-Do you know what a painfinity meme is?
-A painfinity meme?

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.927
I have no idea.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.137
It's a meme that causes infinite pain.

00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:41.266
I just created
a forever-cringe moment in my life!

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:44.645
It's all right.

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:47.147
Why did you have to go and fall down?

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.774
It'll be okay.

00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:51.819
Everyone says
they hated the red underwear.

00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:54.446
Everyone will forget soon.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.574
Man, why did I have to
wear that underwear that night?

00:02:59.284 --> 00:03:00.119

GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU
TAKES DOWN FEMALE ATTACKER

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.419
I enjoyed the awards ceremony
thanks to you.

00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:54.298
It makes me sad to hear that.

00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:57.718
I risked my job as a reporter
to go there, you know.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.305
They say a monk can leave the temple
if they don't like it.

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:04.975
I'd like to know how you feel
about being forced to come here.

00:04:07.227 --> 00:04:08.103
It sucks.

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:10.189
I see.

00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:13.025
You'll be covering K-pop here.
Do you have a favorite artist?

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:15.611
-No.
-Watched any dramas or movies recently?

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.113
-No.
-Do you know any drama titles?

00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:21.241
-No.
-Do you know who RedPink is?

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:24.453
Oh, right!

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:25.579
No.

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:28.874
You've got some nerve, just as I heard.

00:04:28.957 --> 00:04:30.334
It's unfortunate, though.

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.921
You might've been
the political desk's ace reporter.

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:35.047
But here,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.006
you're just a newbie.

00:04:40.594 --> 00:04:42.971
Listen carefully.
High-and-mighty journalism?

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:45.182
We don't need that crap here,
so leave it at home.

00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:49.019
You know the line between gossip
and journalism is paper-thin.

00:04:49.103 --> 00:04:51.730
But that paper-thin line
can change the world.

00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:53.524
So are you saying
an entertainment reporter

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:55.484
isn't as cool as other reporters?

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.487
-I didn't become a reporter to be cool.
-Good.

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:00.656
Try to do well here too.

00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:02.741
You know,

00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:05.744
I do well wherever I go.

00:05:06.537 --> 00:05:09.373
I have high standards.

00:05:10.082 --> 00:05:11.250
You'll need to do extremely well.

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:13.335
You can go now.

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:16.421
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
PROJECT PROPOSAL

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.886
You know, in my opinion,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.348
I think this season
will be a bit different than before.

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:30.936
Mr. Hwang.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.155
-Mr. Hwang!
-Yes, I'm coming.

00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:42.573
You guys can go home now.

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.377
Didn't I tell you
season four was the last one?

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.588
Do you think we're in Hollywood?

00:05:57.671 --> 00:06:00.340
Is Good Detective Kang Pil-gu
the only role I get before I die?

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:02.134
Come on, bro.

00:06:02.217 --> 00:06:04.553
We don't have to go to Hollywood for that.

00:06:04.636 --> 00:06:06.430
Even Chief Inspector lasted for 18 years.

00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:08.515
It was Choi Bul-am's
life-defining character.

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:11.310
That was more than 40 years ago!

00:06:11.393 --> 00:06:13.770
That show ended
before you even learned to read!

00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:15.689
In any case, I won't do the next season.

00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:17.107
I'm doing something different.

00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:19.818
We must've received
synopses for other shows!

00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:40.756
What's this?

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.050
Is this it? Just this one?

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:44.927
It's a melodrama, your favorite.

00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:46.428
A melodrama?

00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:47.679
It's set in the '80s,

00:06:47.763 --> 00:06:49.723
and the male lead
is a post office employee.

00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:51.683
He develops a crush on a woman

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:55.270
who comes every day
to send letters to her dead boyfriend and…

00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:56.605
Jeez, it's too complex.

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:58.982
Hey, that sounds great.

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:02.152
Yes, it's great.
The post office employee is Zo In-sung.

00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:04.696
You're the dead boyfriend.
Still interested?

00:07:07.324 --> 00:07:08.784
Do I get little screen time?

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:12.162
There's not much to say
because you die and disappear.

00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:13.789
You might have about three scenes.

00:07:13.872 --> 00:07:16.375
It's more like a special appearance.

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:18.627
And before he died, he was a detective.

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:22.297
A detective who was stabbed to death
by a serial killer.

00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:24.508
What else is there?

00:07:25.092 --> 00:07:27.386
Why did you only bring this?

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:29.096
There must be more, right?

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:30.722
Bring them all so I can choose.

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:35.102
We haven't gotten anything else.

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:38.355
No other scripts have come in.

00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:41.108
If scripts don't come in,
you need to reach out first!

00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:42.943
If I'm just waiting for scripts to arrive,

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:45.153
why would I need an agency?

00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:47.114
You're right.
It's my fault for being incompetent.

00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:48.907
I'm sorry, bro.

00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:52.786
People probably think
I'm too busy playing Kang Pil-gu.

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:54.705
That's why they're not sending me scripts.

00:07:55.622 --> 00:07:59.251
Send out articles saying
I'm done playing Kang Pil-gu.

00:08:20.063 --> 00:08:21.189

GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU
SEASON 18

00:08:49.134 --> 00:08:50.802
Excuse me, sir.

00:08:52.095 --> 00:08:53.597
I never expected to meet you here.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.767
I'm sorry to bother you,
but can I get an autograph?

00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:58.852
My daughter is a big fan.

00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:01.772
Sure.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.858
What's your daughter's name?

00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:06.693
It's Yu Je-i.

00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:08.111
What a pretty name.

00:09:11.406 --> 00:09:13.909
No, but really, my daughter is a huge fan

00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:15.869
of Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong.

00:09:15.952 --> 00:09:18.789
Gosh, you retired too early.

00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:20.582
If it weren't for that injury…

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:22.626
Goodness, I'm being silly. I'm sorry.

00:09:22.709 --> 00:09:23.835
It's okay.

00:09:31.718 --> 00:09:33.220
It's Yu Je-i.

00:09:36.848 --> 00:09:38.683
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:40.977
Did you get it?

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:56.201
So after her divorce,

00:09:56.284 --> 00:10:00.455
Song Ja-gyeong got so much botox done
that her face was about to explode!

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:04.918
So the next entertainment piece can be
a full story of Song Ja-gyeong's divorce…

00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:08.338
I interviewed Song Si-gyeong yesterday,

00:10:08.422 --> 00:10:09.548
and his voice was so amazing.

00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:12.884
I almost asked him if he could say
"Sweet dreams" to me.

00:10:12.968 --> 00:10:14.469
Oh, man.

00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:17.305
Start the meeting.

00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:22.060
-Broadcasting?
-Chae-eun from Latiseri

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:23.520
landed a role in an SBS mini series.

00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:26.314
I guess the other girl group member
was turned down.

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:28.942
-Any K-pop news?
-Ga-i arrives today after his US concert.

00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:32.195
He's releasing his fifth studio album,
so people will be interested.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:35.490
Cover his arrival scene
and get an interview, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:10:37.284 --> 00:10:38.201
Me?

00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:41.329
You cover K-pop.

00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:44.499
Do you know who Ga-i…

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:46.460
Do you have a clue?

00:10:46.543 --> 00:10:48.170
-I'm sure she does.
-Of course.

00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:49.254
-She'd know.
-It's Ga-i, after all.

00:10:49.337 --> 00:10:51.423
-You can find him online.
-It's Ga-i.

00:11:00.807 --> 00:11:03.685
-Hey, wait a second. What's this?
-What?

00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:04.603
What is it?

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:06.313
PRODUCTION UNDERWAY
FOR GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU SEASON 5!

00:11:06.396 --> 00:11:09.566
This isn't the article I wanted released!
What's the matter with you?

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:10.525
It wasn't me.

00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:12.694
-Who else could it be but…
-Move, please.

00:11:12.777 --> 00:11:14.404
What's going on?
Are you guys escorting the president?

00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:16.114
What's with the heavy security?

00:11:17.365 --> 00:11:18.366
It's Ga-i!

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.869
He just arrived today
after his US concert.

00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:22.746
How many bodyguards does he have?

00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:25.332
I bet there are
tons of reporters out there.

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.627
Hey, you should've told me about this!

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.214
If I walk out with Ga-i,
I'll look like a loser!

00:11:32.297 --> 00:11:35.175
Don't worry about a thing.
No one will pay any attention to you!

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.554
Have you lost your mind?

00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:43.266
It won't be a problem. Just wear these.

00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:44.851
Jeez.

00:11:56.863 --> 00:11:58.406
WELCOME TO TERMINAL 2, ARRIVAL GATE B

00:11:59.991 --> 00:12:00.909
What in the world?

00:12:01.868 --> 00:12:02.827
So many are here already.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.679
Move out of the way! I need to see…

00:12:20.762 --> 00:12:22.097
No, don't push me!

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.062
Get that woman away from him!

00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:32.232
-Protect Ga-i from her!
-Get off of him!

00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:34.401
Someone help me!

00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:40.782
Excuse me!

00:12:42.033 --> 00:12:43.118
Please help me!

00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:46.121
-Me?
-Excuse me, please help!

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.207
Help!

00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:51.835
Hey, I need help!

00:12:52.502 --> 00:12:54.546
Help me out!

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:56.965
Please save me!

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.890
Man, Ga-i had his car waiting
at the entrance and got right in.

00:13:05.974 --> 00:13:08.685
Why do I have to walk
to the parking lot to get to mine?

00:13:08.768 --> 00:13:10.729
Come on, Detective Kang Pil-gu

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:12.897
-doesn't have a sense of entitlement.
-Oh, hey.

00:13:12.981 --> 00:13:14.482
We have your public image to consider.

00:13:15.317 --> 00:13:18.069
-I wonder if that woman is okay.
-Yeah, I wonder.

00:13:18.737 --> 00:13:20.989
Ga-i's fans practically dragged her away.

00:13:21.072 --> 00:13:22.949
It's not like they'll kill her.

00:13:23.033 --> 00:13:24.284
-You're going home, right?
-Yeah.

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:26.411
-Hey, go ahead. I'm leaving.
-Right.

00:13:26.494 --> 00:13:27.787
I need to stop off somewhere.

00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:28.830
Hey, Mr. Bak.

00:13:28.913 --> 00:13:30.373
Are you at your studio?

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:33.209
I was hoping to see you today.

00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:34.461
Get going.

00:13:34.544 --> 00:13:35.962
-We'll be going now.
-Yeah.

00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:38.298
All right.

00:13:40.842 --> 00:13:42.260
Drive safely.

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:43.261
Drive safely, okay?

00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:45.847
Be safe!

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.391
-Hands off!
-Get out of the way!

00:13:48.475 --> 00:13:50.185
-No pushing!
-Move out of the way!

00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:51.102
I said, move!

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:55.273
What do you think you're doing?

00:13:56.191 --> 00:13:57.442
Are you okay?

00:13:57.525 --> 00:13:58.943
She just fell!

00:13:59.694 --> 00:14:00.612
Jeez.

00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:02.197
Are you here to push people around?

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.450
If you're here to guard someone,
do that instead of getting physical!

00:14:05.533 --> 00:14:07.661
You're only disgracing
the artist you're bodyguarding!

00:14:07.744 --> 00:14:10.121
Look at what you're doing.
Do you think you're a bunch of thugs?

00:14:10.205 --> 00:14:11.289
Are you kidding me?

00:14:11.373 --> 00:14:13.083
What if she'd gotten seriously hurt?

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:15.543
Would you have compensated her?
Apologize right now.

00:14:15.627 --> 00:14:17.253
I said apologize!

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.426
Why don't you check and see
if anything's broken or missing?

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.470
Everything is fine, thanks to you.

00:14:25.553 --> 00:14:26.721
Thank you for getting my bag.

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:31.017
I saw how you didn't let
those bodyguards push you around.

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:35.480
Well, my pride won't allow me
to get pushed around by jerks like that.

00:14:39.776 --> 00:14:42.862
Are you sure you're okay?
Your jacket's torn.

00:14:42.946 --> 00:14:44.489
I'm fine.

00:14:44.572 --> 00:14:46.866
My body's a little sore,
but I don't think I'm hurt.

00:14:50.412 --> 00:14:51.705
Why are you laughing?

00:14:53.498 --> 00:14:55.291
Is this situation funny to you?

00:14:56.126 --> 00:14:57.210
No.

00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:02.215
No, it's not funny at all.

00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:07.804
I almost got to hold his hand.

00:15:07.887 --> 00:15:10.223
-Did you get into a fight with the fans?
-There she is!

00:15:10.306 --> 00:15:11.391
No.

00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:15.311
-It's her!
-It's her. Let's go and see.

00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:17.147
Get that woman away from him!

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.649
-Protect Ga-i from her!
-Get off of him!

00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:21.776
Get away from him, woman!

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.278
-Grab that woman!
-No, I didn't…

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.784
Run!

00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:32.829
Get her!

00:15:32.912 --> 00:15:35.081
-It's her!
-Stop!

00:15:59.689 --> 00:16:01.191
He had nothing to do with it.

00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:02.859
-Just talk to me.
-Sorry?

00:16:02.942 --> 00:16:05.653
You got us all wrong.
We're here to thank you.

00:16:05.737 --> 00:16:08.448
The girl those bodyguards pushed earlier

00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:10.033
is my friend.

00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:13.119
Thank you for helping us.

00:16:13.203 --> 00:16:14.621
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:16:14.704 --> 00:16:17.665
Thank you for fighting on our behalf.
You were freaking amazing!

00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:19.626
-You were a hero!
-You're the best!

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:21.211
We have to get going now.

00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:22.921
Goodbye and thank you!

00:16:23.004 --> 00:16:23.838
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:16:23.922 --> 00:16:24.964
-Come on, guys.
-Let's go!

00:16:31.888 --> 00:16:35.600
Were you trying to protect me just now?

00:16:35.683 --> 00:16:36.726
Yes.

00:16:37.769 --> 00:16:40.897
But I guess we ran for nothing.

00:16:43.608 --> 00:16:45.276
Oh, right.
I'm supposed to cover his arrival.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.569
Damn it, I'm screwed!

00:16:47.821 --> 00:16:49.572
By the way,
thank you for picking up my bag.

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:50.532
Goodbye!

00:16:51.407 --> 00:16:52.242
Hey, wait…

00:16:56.287 --> 00:16:57.789
Hey, wait! You…

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.793
WI JEONG-SIN, SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:05.713
Now, stretch your back. Very nice.

00:17:05.797 --> 00:17:07.632
Now, let's lower your left leg first.

00:17:10.718 --> 00:17:12.428
Nicely done, sir.

00:17:16.391 --> 00:17:18.142
I can't believe this.

00:17:22.063 --> 00:17:24.816
You must have written a ton of scripts,

00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:26.818
seeing how you have time for Pilates.

00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:28.862
Writing takes a lot of energy, you know.

00:17:28.945 --> 00:17:30.530
I make time for it even when I'm busy.

00:17:31.197 --> 00:17:32.115
Didn't you say

00:17:32.198 --> 00:17:35.076
you were going to take a year off
after season four

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:36.286
and focus on directing?

00:17:36.369 --> 00:17:37.912
Have you given up on directing?

00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:40.373
Who knew I'd be writing for so long?

00:17:40.456 --> 00:17:42.208
When we decided to
turn Kang Pil-gu into a drama series,

00:17:42.292 --> 00:17:44.752
I should've done the directing as well.

00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:49.299
If you had,
Kang Pil-gu wouldn't be here today

00:17:49.382 --> 00:17:51.342
because I wouldn't have done it.

00:17:53.803 --> 00:17:56.180
Anyway, I'm still under contract
with the production company,

00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:58.266
so I can't just do whatever I want.

00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:01.269
Say you can't do it.

00:18:03.521 --> 00:18:05.189
Darn, I got a bruise.

00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:07.525
This is going to last for a while.

00:18:10.403 --> 00:18:12.864
-Someone help me!
-Get that woman away from him!

00:18:12.947 --> 00:18:15.074
Get off of him!

00:18:15.158 --> 00:18:17.702
-Move!
-You scared Ga-i!

00:18:17.785 --> 00:18:19.454
Please help me!

00:18:19.537 --> 00:18:20.955
Come on, help me!

00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:31.007
-Turn off the light.
-Yes, sir.

00:18:37.388 --> 00:18:38.473
Let's see here.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.143
LIM HYEON-JUN TAKES DOWN ASSAILANT

00:18:46.397 --> 00:18:48.358
AWARDS CEREMONY RED CARPET BRAWL

00:18:54.697 --> 00:18:56.157
Right!

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.784
It was that punk from before.

00:19:02.872 --> 00:19:04.791
-Pil-gu.
-Pil-gu?

00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:07.377
This guy's name is Pil-gu?

00:19:08.336 --> 00:19:09.837
Are you serious?

00:19:10.505 --> 00:19:12.757
Jeong-sin, you're covering entertainment.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.759
I'm saying this
as a concerned younger brother,

00:19:14.842 --> 00:19:16.844
but you need to know
the names of famous actors.

00:19:16.928 --> 00:19:18.346
He's an actor?

00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:20.390
Let me tell you about our dear Pil-gu.

00:19:20.473 --> 00:19:23.101
His real name is Lim Hyeon-jun,
but he's better known as Kang Pil-gu.

00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:26.354
He shaped the success of all four seasons
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:19:26.437 --> 00:19:27.480
He's a flawless,

00:19:27.563 --> 00:19:29.357
undisputed iconic actor.

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:31.818
An "iconic actor"?

00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:33.444
One among many.

00:19:33.528 --> 00:19:36.823
And his character speaks for itself.
He's like the next Yu Jae-seok.

00:19:40.118 --> 00:19:41.577
Throw a fit and tell them you can't do it.

00:19:41.661 --> 00:19:42.704
Throw a fit?

00:19:42.787 --> 00:19:45.164
Just tell them you can't do it.

00:19:45.248 --> 00:19:47.625
What will they do
if both the actor and writer refuse?

00:19:47.709 --> 00:19:49.085
Come on.

00:19:49.168 --> 00:19:52.547
I have a certain social standing
and reputation to maintain now,

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.548
and you're telling me to throw a fit?

00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:54.716
That'll make me look like a jerk.

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:56.843
You're not the only one
with a public image to protect.

00:19:58.344 --> 00:20:00.930
Wow, I'm so glad you brought that up.

00:20:01.014 --> 00:20:04.517
An actor's public image is everything,
but starting with your graduation project

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.603
and the Kang Pil-gu drama series,
it's been six, no…

00:20:09.355 --> 00:20:11.607
I played Kang Pil-gu
for seven whopping years!

00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:13.568
No one's sending me scripts
for anything else!

00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:16.237
-This is a huge decision for me too!
-Mr. Lim.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.990
Do you think I'm the only writer in Korea?

00:20:19.073 --> 00:20:19.991
Even if I tell them no,

00:20:20.074 --> 00:20:22.910
they'll just find someone else
to write the next season.

00:20:22.994 --> 00:20:25.413
The copyright belongs to the writer,

00:20:25.496 --> 00:20:27.331
so you can just say you won't do it.

00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:30.960
To tell you the truth,

00:20:32.003 --> 00:20:34.589
I bought a small building last year

00:20:34.672 --> 00:20:37.550
and took out a huge loan for it.

00:20:40.178 --> 00:20:41.304
Mr. Bak.

00:20:41.387 --> 00:20:44.098
I mean, Byeong-gi.

00:20:44.182 --> 00:20:46.100
-Why don't you kill me off instead?
-Come on.

00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:48.227
Just kill me off in the first episode.

00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:51.189
Yes, let's kill Kang Pil-gu!

00:20:51.272 --> 00:20:54.817
Come on, we're talking about us here!
You can do this for me, right?

00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:56.903
The next Yu Jae-seok, my ass.

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:00.031
I just mean
there's nothing to dig up on him.

00:21:00.114 --> 00:21:03.367
-That's due to a lack of proper digging.
-So what?

00:21:03.451 --> 00:21:06.871
That idiot caused a scene that day
because he thought I was a criminal.

00:21:06.954 --> 00:21:09.957
And thanks to him,
I got bumped to the sports tabloid!

00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.834
Come on. That was decided days ago--

00:21:11.918 --> 00:21:14.837
There was a chance I didn't have to
if it hadn't been for this!

00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:16.714
Kang Pil-gu?

00:21:29.185 --> 00:21:30.895
HAEUN BANK
FAIR AND ETHICAL BANKING, HAEUN FEEL MONEY

00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:37.193
Damn it.

00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:44.617
Sir, are you crying?

00:21:47.662 --> 00:21:50.998
I've become a slave to Kang Pil-gu!

00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:54.210
Come on, seriously.

00:21:55.253 --> 00:21:59.132
There's no escaping him, damn it!

00:22:02.426 --> 00:22:03.594
Goddamn it.

00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:15.815
-Mother!
-My son!

00:22:17.483 --> 00:22:18.651
-Sit down.
-Okay.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.404
You didn't have to make
such a huge meal at this hour.

00:22:23.489 --> 00:22:25.158
I'm so sorry,

00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:27.118
but I have to head out for a shoot.

00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:30.872
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

00:22:30.955 --> 00:22:32.498
By the way,
when's your induction ceremony?

00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:36.210
I'd like to skip it altogether.

00:22:36.294 --> 00:22:38.129
I don't want to make a fuss.

00:22:38.838 --> 00:22:40.381
I just want to go to work quietly.

00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:09.410
This video of you
getting dragged by Ga-i's fans

00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:11.162
is trending on UTube.

00:23:12.747 --> 00:23:13.831
I saw it too.

00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:15.875
You said you do well anywhere.
Is this what you meant?

00:23:17.376 --> 00:23:19.670
We were the only ones
who missed Ga-i's arrival scene.

00:23:19.754 --> 00:23:22.089
Just our paper!

00:23:23.341 --> 00:23:24.258
You're out of K-pop coverage.

00:23:24.342 --> 00:23:25.968
Lim Hyeon-jun's interview is today, right?

00:23:26.052 --> 00:23:27.970
-Yes, it's at 2 p.m. at King's Back--
-Kang Pil-gu?

00:23:29.722 --> 00:23:30.640
You know about Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:23:31.224 --> 00:23:33.851
-Yes. I'll go.
-Why?

00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:39.899
To make up for yesterday's mistake.

00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:44.737
I'm Lee Jae-hyeong,
your newly appointed president.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.697
I plan to develop Sports Eunseong

00:23:46.781 --> 00:23:50.159
into a global sports tabloid
that can spread and share

00:23:50.243 --> 00:23:52.662
Korea's diverse entertainment,
culture, and sports news,

00:23:52.745 --> 00:23:55.206
all in real-time
with people around the world.

00:24:03.631 --> 00:24:05.132
WI JEONG-SIN, SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:24:08.886 --> 00:24:09.804
SPORTS EUNSEONG
WI JEONG-SIN

00:24:10.596 --> 00:24:12.223
-As for the…
-You found all the materials, right?

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:15.685
-Yes, but…
-Then hurry up and send it out.

00:24:58.394 --> 00:25:00.021
You have a video, right?

00:25:00.104 --> 00:25:01.522
You went to entertain some VIPs

00:25:01.605 --> 00:25:04.650
and took a video on your phone,
hoping it might pay off.

00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:07.069
I'll need you to give it to me.

00:25:07.653 --> 00:25:08.529
Who are you?

00:25:08.612 --> 00:25:09.488
Me?

00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:11.532
I'm a reporter.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.380
Nice to meet you.

00:25:27.173 --> 00:25:28.841
-I'm Wi Jeong-sin.
-Of course.

00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:30.259
Thank you.

00:25:31.427 --> 00:25:32.303
Right.

00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:36.223
Here. I'm Hwang Ji-sun.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.602
-All right. Please take a seat.
-Thank you.

00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:44.607
Great.

00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:48.486
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin.

00:25:49.236 --> 00:25:50.905
It's our first time, right?

00:25:50.988 --> 00:25:53.699
First time? You must have a bad memory.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.577
We actually met in a very dramatic way.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.870
Twice, in fact.

00:25:59.663 --> 00:26:02.917
By the way, is Bahn Soo-jung
an actress with King's Back?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.379
Yes, Soo-jung is a newcomer
who joined us last year.

00:26:16.722 --> 00:26:17.640
Hold on.

00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:19.225
Be quiet!

00:26:19.934 --> 00:26:20.768
You!

00:26:22.436 --> 00:26:24.313
I'll cover the cost for your phone.
Call me at 0259-2151.

00:26:24.397 --> 00:26:26.023
Give me a call. I'm really sorry!

00:26:26.107 --> 00:26:27.775
Are you really a reporter?

00:26:28.943 --> 00:26:33.656
-Is this even real?
-Excuse me?

00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:34.824
-Look here.
-Goodness.

00:26:34.907 --> 00:26:37.576
Do you know what happens
if you impersonate a reporter?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.038
What's this guy talking about?

00:26:41.122 --> 00:26:43.457
Mr. Hwang, call Sports Eunseong right now.

00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:45.668
And check her ID.

00:26:47.628 --> 00:26:48.629
There's no way

00:26:49.338 --> 00:26:51.340
this woman is a reporter.

00:26:52.174 --> 00:26:53.008
Excuse me!

00:26:54.427 --> 00:26:55.636
Wow.

00:26:56.512 --> 00:26:57.471
Ms. Wi.

00:26:58.931 --> 00:26:59.932
We're very sorry.

00:27:00.933 --> 00:27:04.061
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:27:04.145 --> 00:27:05.729
Mr. Lim.

00:27:06.856 --> 00:27:07.857
Right.

00:27:09.108 --> 00:27:12.570
My job entails doing things
I've never done before.

00:27:12.653 --> 00:27:14.613
So I overreacted. I'm sorry.

00:27:14.697 --> 00:27:17.575
Right. I'm glad we cleared up
the misunderstanding.

00:27:17.658 --> 00:27:19.743
So, can I ask you some questions?

00:27:19.827 --> 00:27:21.036
Yes, of course.

00:27:25.624 --> 00:27:26.792
So…

00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:30.337
Mr. Lim, out of all the work you've done,
with the exception of Kang Pil-gu,

00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:32.715
can you name your favorite project?

00:27:40.014 --> 00:27:41.307
Well,

00:27:41.891 --> 00:27:45.895
Kang Pil-gu is the only project
I've ever worked on.

00:27:47.688 --> 00:27:51.775
I also did a movie called Sad Waltz
a long time ago,

00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:54.403
but it's a little awkward to choose

00:27:55.696 --> 00:27:56.947
between the two.

00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:58.824
I see. All right, then.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:04.497
Shall we start talking about
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu?

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.874
Yes, that sounds good.

00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:08.959
Which season?

00:28:09.877 --> 00:28:10.711
Excuse me?

00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:15.799
There are multiple seasons.
Which one should we begin with?

00:28:18.844 --> 00:28:19.678
Well…

00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:22.723
The most recent one, of course.

00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:24.391
What are your thoughts?

00:28:28.312 --> 00:28:29.522
Wow.

00:28:29.605 --> 00:28:32.399
That ended six months ago,
and you're asking me about my thoughts?

00:28:33.275 --> 00:28:35.319
This is a bit underwhelming.

00:28:35.903 --> 00:28:38.364
Your thoughts can be different
right after filming

00:28:38.447 --> 00:28:39.949
and can change again after six months.

00:28:40.032 --> 00:28:42.451
Yes, of course.

00:28:50.125 --> 00:28:51.377
Right. Of course.

00:28:52.962 --> 00:28:54.588
The last season

00:28:54.672 --> 00:28:57.216
ended with me falling off a building.

00:28:59.468 --> 00:29:02.763
It ended without revealing
whether I died or not.

00:29:03.264 --> 00:29:05.224
Yes, it was quite suspenseful.

00:29:10.229 --> 00:29:11.772
Wow, Ms. Wi.

00:29:13.023 --> 00:29:15.025
-You haven't watched the drama.
-Excuse me?

00:29:16.277 --> 00:29:18.779
The last season ended
with Kang Pil-gu getting promoted

00:29:18.862 --> 00:29:20.406
after catching a serial killer.

00:29:21.532 --> 00:29:23.951
Gosh, I guess you were so busy

00:29:24.034 --> 00:29:27.580
that you didn't even have time
to skim the plot summary on your way here.

00:29:28.163 --> 00:29:29.456
Well, this is unfortunate.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.959
Since you're not clear on the content,
I guess the interview

00:29:33.252 --> 00:29:34.253
will have to end here.

00:29:36.255 --> 00:29:37.756
You see, I…

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.882
I understand.

00:29:39.425 --> 00:29:40.676
It's a real shame,

00:29:41.677 --> 00:29:43.429
but let's do this interview next time.

00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:47.349
Come on.

00:29:48.142 --> 00:29:51.312
With so many seasons,
anyone could get confused.

00:29:54.064 --> 00:29:55.274
Did he just make a fool out of me?

00:29:58.777 --> 00:30:00.070
Are you crazy?

00:30:00.154 --> 00:30:01.989
That interview was so hard to land,
and you blew it?

00:30:03.741 --> 00:30:07.369
Damn it, what's the matter with you?

00:30:07.453 --> 00:30:09.496
Have you lost your mind?

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.957
You can't embarrass a reporter like that!

00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:13.751
I did no such thing.

00:30:13.834 --> 00:30:16.295
She wasn't prepared,
so I taught her a lesson.

00:30:16.378 --> 00:30:19.506
What gives you the right
to teach a reporter a lesson?

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.635
Do you know what that woman does?

00:30:22.718 --> 00:30:25.846
-What do you mean? She's a reporter!
-That woman

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.265
works at a hostess bar.

00:30:29.058 --> 00:30:30.059
What?

00:30:32.811 --> 00:30:34.563
Jeez.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.151
-Where are you?
-Home, why? I'm busy.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.945
Round up your theater and film friends
from college

00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:43.864
who are experts in juicy gossip.

00:30:43.947 --> 00:30:45.908
Round them up?
Do you think you're a gang boss?

00:30:45.991 --> 00:30:47.242
I've got a high-paying gig for you.
Are you in?

00:30:47.326 --> 00:30:48.410
Of course, I'm in!

00:30:48.994 --> 00:30:50.454
-How many people do you need?
-Forget it.

00:30:50.537 --> 00:30:51.997
The story might get leaked,
so do it yourself.

00:30:52.748 --> 00:30:53.582
Damn it.

00:30:53.666 --> 00:30:54.541
Hello?

00:30:55.793 --> 00:30:57.628
Jeez, her phone manners are the worst.

00:30:59.963 --> 00:31:02.091
This protein shake is tasty. Drink it.

00:31:02.174 --> 00:31:03.175
Was that your sister?

00:31:03.842 --> 00:31:05.928
Yeah, she said she has a gig for me.

00:31:06.679 --> 00:31:09.181
-A gig? Can I do it too?
-I guess you could…

00:31:10.557 --> 00:31:11.892
No, never mind.

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:14.603
It's probably not for
a privileged med student like you.

00:31:15.813 --> 00:31:17.481
By the way,
why don't you have a TV at home?

00:31:17.564 --> 00:31:20.234
My sister hates it. She's a total boomer.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.195
-My brother's a boomer too.
-Really?

00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:26.448
Well, what does your brother do?

00:31:26.532 --> 00:31:28.325
-My brother?
-Is he a doctor?

00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:32.871
His job starts with a "D" too.

00:31:32.955 --> 00:31:33.956
He's a detective.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.044
A detective? Like Kang Pil-gu?

00:31:39.128 --> 00:31:41.213
Right.

00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:51.765
Mr. Lim, out of all the work you've done,
with the exception of Kang Pil-gu,

00:31:51.849 --> 00:31:54.476
can you name your favorite project?

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.603
Who will give him a role
in a melodrama or rom-com at his age?

00:31:56.687 --> 00:31:58.272
He's stuck with Kang Pil-gu.

00:31:58.939 --> 00:32:00.107
We don't get any.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.900
No scripts have come in.

00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:08.574
LIM HYEON-JUN
LIM HYEON-JUN, YOU'RE DEAD

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:12.035
Starting now,

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:15.539
dig through Lim Hyeon-jun's social media
and find dirt on him

00:32:15.622 --> 00:32:18.417
with a female celebrity
or find any signs of dating.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.295
Jeong-sin,
why are you going after my bro Pil-gu?

00:32:21.378 --> 00:32:22.713
Lim Hyeon-jun gave me something.

00:32:22.796 --> 00:32:24.757
I'm just returning the favor.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.009
What exactly did he give you?

00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:31.513
Humiliation.

00:32:35.476 --> 00:32:36.518
Jeong-sin.

00:32:36.602 --> 00:32:38.020
Do you know what a PSS is?

00:32:38.103 --> 00:32:39.271
Of course, you don't.

00:32:39.354 --> 00:32:41.315
It means, "Positive-Story Superstar."

00:32:41.398 --> 00:32:43.066
That's the kind of person he is!

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:44.151
Positive story?

00:32:44.735 --> 00:32:46.069
What positive stories?

00:32:47.488 --> 00:32:50.741
First off, he still drives a domestic car.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.830
The car needs to…

00:32:56.914 --> 00:32:59.208
That car has been sitting there for ages.

00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:00.751
Who does it belong to?

00:33:00.834 --> 00:33:03.879
He was the first to cut rent in half
during COVID-19.

00:33:03.962 --> 00:33:05.547
COVID-19 ended ages ago!

00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:08.008
How much longer
do I have to be a "good landlord"?

00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:10.511
I'm paying more in monthly interest
than I'm getting in rent!

00:33:11.345 --> 00:33:12.805
And he has the nicest personality.

00:33:12.888 --> 00:33:15.224
Nobody has ever seen him get angry.

00:33:15.307 --> 00:33:16.558
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.063
I'm so sorry.

00:33:22.981 --> 00:33:23.816
And that's not all.

00:33:23.899 --> 00:33:25.776
He's the best
when it comes to fan service.

00:33:25.859 --> 00:33:27.778
-It's Kang Pil-gu!
-Can I get an autograph?

00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:29.446
-It's Kang Pil-gu!
-I'm a fan!

00:33:34.076 --> 00:33:37.996
-Pil-gu!
-Pil-gu!

00:33:42.835 --> 00:33:43.669
You know,

00:33:43.752 --> 00:33:47.548
with a decade as a reporter covering
the social, political, and economic desks,

00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:49.842
I've pretty much seen everything.

00:33:49.925 --> 00:33:51.802
But I've come to realize something.

00:33:51.885 --> 00:33:53.512
Everyone has dirt to hide,

00:33:53.595 --> 00:33:55.389
and where there's smoke, there's fire.

00:33:55.973 --> 00:33:57.266
My senior colleagues
at the political desk said

00:33:57.349 --> 00:33:59.184
politicians and celebrities are similar.

00:33:59.268 --> 00:34:01.562
I understand what politicians are like
more than anyone.

00:34:01.645 --> 00:34:04.314
Therefore, you can say
I understand celebrities too.

00:34:05.232 --> 00:34:08.151
There's always another side to them,
unknown to the public.

00:34:08.235 --> 00:34:10.320
It's a hidden side that no one knows about

00:34:10.404 --> 00:34:13.490
and is far from beautiful.

00:34:13.574 --> 00:34:14.908
Do you really have to do this?

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.579
-One million won.
-What?

00:34:21.081 --> 00:34:23.333
One million won is calling my name!

00:34:28.547 --> 00:34:30.173
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:34:30.757 --> 00:34:32.384
What kind of actor do you like?

00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:36.430
I'm not capable
of favoring specific actors,

00:34:36.513 --> 00:34:40.350
but I respect their acting abilities
and the narratives they bring to life.

00:34:40.434 --> 00:34:41.268
In particular,

00:34:41.351 --> 00:34:45.397
I highly value actors who have
successfully portrayed various characters.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.356
Are you saying

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:50.819
someone who has played
only one character isn't an actor?

00:34:50.903 --> 00:34:52.613
I didn't catch that.

00:34:57.659 --> 00:34:59.828
So even an AI assistant like you
feels that way.

00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:03.123
I want to play different characters too,

00:35:03.206 --> 00:35:04.833
but nobody's giving me a chance.

00:35:06.543 --> 00:35:08.253
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:35:08.879 --> 00:35:10.756
Do you think I'll get an opportunity…

00:35:12.257 --> 00:35:13.342
to play a variety of roles?

00:35:13.425 --> 00:35:15.552
Opportunity comes to those
who are prepared.

00:35:15.636 --> 00:35:19.097
As long as you're passionate
about playing diverse roles,

00:35:19.181 --> 00:35:21.058
that opportunity will definitely come.

00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:25.520
Hyeon-jun.

00:35:29.232 --> 00:35:30.150
When did you get here?

00:35:31.068 --> 00:35:32.694
Just now. Who were you talking to?

00:35:32.778 --> 00:35:33.695
It's me, Su-ji.

00:35:34.321 --> 00:35:38.075
Did you know that Su-ji is quite humorous?

00:35:38.617 --> 00:35:39.534
You want to see?

00:35:40.869 --> 00:35:43.205
Hey, Sui-ji. Tell me a funny story.

00:35:43.872 --> 00:35:45.624
You can't help but laugh at this.

00:35:45.707 --> 00:35:48.919
When do you weigh the most?

00:35:52.005 --> 00:35:53.006
When you're "full of yourself."

00:35:58.679 --> 00:35:59.846
When you're full of yourself!

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.435
She said "when you're full of yourself"!

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:06.728
That's funny.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.858
Lim Hyeon-jun and Jin Su-a
have the same passport holders!

00:36:11.942 --> 00:36:13.110
Oh, you're right!

00:36:13.193 --> 00:36:14.027
The colors are different,

00:36:14.111 --> 00:36:15.904
but they have
the same brand and model bracelet.

00:36:17.531 --> 00:36:19.324
And they did
an outdoor clothing commercial.

00:36:21.201 --> 00:36:23.620
Hey, this is a sure thing!

00:36:23.704 --> 00:36:25.080
Yes, we did it!

00:36:26.748 --> 00:36:28.792
-But there's a problem.
-A problem?

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:31.086
These photos are from three years ago.

00:36:31.169 --> 00:36:32.796
Three years ago? What about now?

00:36:32.879 --> 00:36:35.007
How would I know? They probably broke up.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.299
Hey!

00:36:38.343 --> 00:36:39.261
LIM HYEON-JUN & JIN SU-A?

00:36:39.344 --> 00:36:40.929
No, that's not it.

00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:45.225
I can't get in touch
with Mr. Lim at the moment.

00:36:45.308 --> 00:36:48.353
Let me confirm with him first and…

00:36:48.437 --> 00:36:49.396
Yes, exactly.

00:36:49.479 --> 00:36:52.607
Yes, Mr. Park. Okay, take care.

00:36:52.691 --> 00:36:55.444
This reporter is a damn lunatic!

00:36:56.319 --> 00:36:57.487
Unbelievable.

00:36:57.571 --> 00:36:59.031
This is the result

00:36:59.114 --> 00:37:02.200
of teaching that reporter a lesson,
don't you think?

00:37:02.743 --> 00:37:04.202
Come on, everyone in Korea knows

00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:07.205
that we dated for just a month
three years ago!

00:37:07.289 --> 00:37:08.874
Why write an article like this now?

00:37:11.168 --> 00:37:12.461
What did Su-a say?

00:37:12.544 --> 00:37:15.047
What do you think?
She's just as pissed as you.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.174
What should we do?
Deny that you're dating?

00:37:17.257 --> 00:37:19.092
Wait, we should just say you two broke up.

00:37:19.676 --> 00:37:20.552
But three years ago?

00:37:21.053 --> 00:37:22.637
LIM HYEON-JUN & JIN SU-A
BUDDING ROMANCE OR JUST A COINCIDENCE?

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.724
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin.

00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:27.893
Oh, man.

00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:31.354
In all my life, never did I think
I'd memorize a reporter's name.

00:37:40.238 --> 00:37:42.574
Why is my name on an article
that I didn't even write?

00:37:42.657 --> 00:37:45.368
It was written based on your research,
so that's why your name is on it.

00:37:45.452 --> 00:37:47.079
I thought you suspected they were dating.

00:37:47.162 --> 00:37:49.164
I said I had suspicions.
I never said they were.

00:37:49.247 --> 00:37:50.832
You can't release an article
without checking!

00:37:50.916 --> 00:37:52.250
Be quiet.

00:37:52.334 --> 00:37:54.002
This hasn't been fact-checked.

00:37:54.086 --> 00:37:55.462
This was from three years ago,

00:37:55.545 --> 00:37:57.255
and I said I didn't think
they were still dating.

00:37:57.339 --> 00:38:00.550
Then release an article
saying they already broke up.

00:38:00.634 --> 00:38:01.510
How does that work?

00:38:01.593 --> 00:38:03.053
Why are you acting dumb?

00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:05.013
Don't you know how things work here?

00:38:08.266 --> 00:38:10.060
METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:38:10.143 --> 00:38:11.895
"ACTOR LIM HYEON-JUN"
DONATION CEREMONY FOR CRIME VICTIM SUPPORT

00:38:15.315 --> 00:38:16.983
He is an honorary police officer

00:38:17.067 --> 00:38:19.945
who made a gracious donation to provide
economic aid to victims of crime.

00:38:20.028 --> 00:38:22.989
Please welcome
Actor Lim Hyeon-jun to the podium.

00:38:42.634 --> 00:38:47.472
I'd like to request the understanding
of the reporters gathered here today.

00:38:47.556 --> 00:38:49.558
Unfortunately, Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong

00:38:49.641 --> 00:38:53.520
will not be allowed
to take part in this interview.

00:38:53.603 --> 00:38:56.982
I'm sorry, but we must ask
the reporter to leave.

00:38:59.109 --> 00:39:00.735
Who is Wi Jeong-sin?

00:39:01.444 --> 00:39:02.404
Who is that?

00:39:33.268 --> 00:39:35.228
We kindly ask everyone to remain quiet.

00:40:05.091 --> 00:40:06.885
Mr. Lim, look this way for the camera!

00:40:06.968 --> 00:40:09.512
-Mr. Lim, give us a big smile!
-Can you make a heart with your hands?

00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:11.973
PRESS

00:40:12.057 --> 00:40:13.975
You got kicked out?
What do you mean, what should you do?

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:15.977
Are you really asking me that?

00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:21.274
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

00:40:22.108 --> 00:40:24.527
LIM HYEON-JUN POSTS SUSHI PHOTO

LIM HYEON-JUN UNDER FIRE
FOR BAD FAN MEETING BEHAVIOR

00:40:26.404 --> 00:40:27.489
I'm home.

00:40:27.572 --> 00:40:29.658
LIM HYEON-JUN FACES BACKLASH
FOR BIASED BEHAVIOR ON SET

00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:30.659
TWO-FACED "GOOD DETECTIVE"

00:40:30.742 --> 00:40:31.743
I'm going to wash up.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.956
PUBLISH REQUEST SENT!

00:40:41.002 --> 00:40:42.963
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:40:44.422 --> 00:40:46.007
-Hello.
-Good morning.

00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:48.301
-Good luck.
-Have a good day.

00:40:48.385 --> 00:40:49.928
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:40:50.011 --> 00:40:51.763
Good morning.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.229
YOU HAVE 234 NEW EMAILS

00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:01.856
Wi Jeong-sin. I'll remember your name.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.483
You'd better delete those articles.

00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:07.946
-Reporters like you suck.
-Quit your job, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:41:08.029 --> 00:41:09.656
Delete, delete, delete.

00:41:10.198 --> 00:41:11.283
DELETE SELECTED EMAILS?
CONFIRM

00:41:11.366 --> 00:41:12.200
ALL 234 EMAILS MOVED TO TRASH

00:41:17.747 --> 00:41:21.167
I got hate mail from Lim Hyeon-jun's fans
because of you.

00:41:23.211 --> 00:41:24.587
-I'm sorry.
-Nice job.

00:41:25.171 --> 00:41:26.840
Keep up the good work.

00:41:26.923 --> 00:41:27.924
Are you free tonight?

00:41:29.634 --> 00:41:31.219
LIM HYEON-JUN MISTREATS STAFF MEMBER

00:41:31.303 --> 00:41:32.637
We're in trouble!

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:36.641
"Hyeon-jun suspected of abuse of power"
is trending right now!

00:41:36.725 --> 00:41:38.310
-What?
-What in the world

00:41:38.393 --> 00:41:40.729
gave you the idea
to publicly humiliate a reporter?

00:41:40.812 --> 00:41:43.606
-That reporter--
-She's going to be all over you now!

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.775
Oh, who cares?

00:41:45.859 --> 00:41:48.028
I've done a lot of good over the years.

00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:51.197
The public is on my side,
and so are the reporters.

00:41:51.281 --> 00:41:52.574
Drops of water make a mighty ocean.

00:41:52.657 --> 00:41:54.993
Your public image will take a hit
if these articles pile up.

00:41:55.076 --> 00:41:57.412
You think that's the right idiom
for this situation?

00:41:57.495 --> 00:41:58.997
Whatever.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.541
This is much worse than a romance scandal.

00:42:01.624 --> 00:42:02.792
Why are you blaming me?

00:42:02.876 --> 00:42:06.004
That lunatic is the one
who stirred up trouble!

00:42:06.087 --> 00:42:09.382
Come on, don't be like that!

00:42:09.466 --> 00:42:10.884
Make up with that reporter, bro.

00:42:10.967 --> 00:42:13.136
I'll set up a meeting today.

00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:14.679
Who says I have to?

00:42:14.763 --> 00:42:17.474
Look, another article just got posted.

00:42:17.557 --> 00:42:19.476
Why is this speeding up?
What are you doing?

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:21.644
Hey, bro, wait a minute!

00:42:21.728 --> 00:42:22.687
Bro!

00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:25.357
CHUNGHYO HALL

00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:36.534
Why are you grunting?

00:42:49.422 --> 00:42:52.592
I'm very sorry about what happened.

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:03.311
Ms. Wi, there's no apology big enough
to undo the disrespect

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:06.398
we showed you
during that public appearance.

00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:08.483
Ms. Wi is at fault too.

00:43:09.692 --> 00:43:13.154
She shouldn't have written about
an alleged dating rumor.

00:43:13.238 --> 00:43:14.572
It was my mistake as desk chief.

00:43:14.656 --> 00:43:17.742
Goodness, not at all!

00:43:18.618 --> 00:43:21.162
-We look forward to working with you.
-Likewise.

00:43:21.246 --> 00:43:23.915
We look forward to receiving
more exclusives from you.

00:43:23.998 --> 00:43:27.419
Is there even any doubt?
Of course, we will!

00:43:29.921 --> 00:43:31.339
Enough of this.

00:43:31.423 --> 00:43:33.007
Please accept a drink.

00:43:33.091 --> 00:43:33.925
Here.

00:43:38.096 --> 00:43:39.013
What are you doing?

00:43:39.639 --> 00:43:40.723
What's the matter with you?

00:43:42.517 --> 00:43:46.146
I'm here to receive an apology,
not to give one.

00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:47.605
Why are you apologizing on my behalf?

00:43:47.689 --> 00:43:50.733
-I'm not sorry at all.
-What are you doing?

00:43:50.817 --> 00:43:52.235
We're not pushovers.

00:43:52.318 --> 00:43:54.362
She screwed us over
for not doing the interview.

00:43:54.446 --> 00:43:56.030
So why the hell are you apologizing?

00:43:57.073 --> 00:44:00.034
Don't you agree?
Do you intend to apologize?

00:44:02.996 --> 00:44:03.913
Of course,

00:44:04.998 --> 00:44:06.166
I don't intend to apologize.

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:09.419
I don't even want an apology anymore.

00:44:09.502 --> 00:44:11.504
It's ridiculous to cater to every tantrum

00:44:11.588 --> 00:44:13.006
of a middle-aged man acting like a diva!

00:44:16.134 --> 00:44:18.553
Then there's no reason to stay here.

00:44:19.262 --> 00:44:20.597
I feel the same way too!

00:44:37.655 --> 00:44:40.200
I thought you'd come to your senses,
but I guess not.

00:44:40.742 --> 00:44:42.243
I've never lost my senses.

00:44:42.327 --> 00:44:43.912
After all, Jeong-sin
literally means "senses."

00:44:43.995 --> 00:44:44.829
That's not funny.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.750
Is this the work you'll be doing?

00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:56.466
Imagine this is the political desk.

00:44:57.509 --> 00:45:00.512
Were you this sloppy
and emotional over there too?

00:45:01.054 --> 00:45:04.265
Would you have interviewed assemblymen
without knowing a thing about them?

00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:08.144
Or would you have run your mouth
and made them your mortal enemies?

00:45:09.854 --> 00:45:11.231
Do you want to bury Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:45:11.981 --> 00:45:14.400
Fine. Go ahead and bury him.

00:45:15.652 --> 00:45:16.903
But at least get to know

00:45:18.488 --> 00:45:20.240
who it is you're burying.

00:45:21.741 --> 00:45:22.992
That's how you bury him for good.

00:45:27.288 --> 00:45:28.122
Do well.

00:45:41.135 --> 00:45:43.012
Imagine this is the political desk.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.975
Were you this sloppy
and emotional over there too?

00:45:49.686 --> 00:45:50.520
Ms. Wi.

00:45:50.603 --> 00:45:52.105
You haven't watched the drama.

00:45:52.188 --> 00:45:54.816
Since you're not clear on the content,
I guess the interview

00:45:56.025 --> 00:45:57.026
will have to end.

00:45:59.153 --> 00:46:00.572
But at least get to know

00:46:00.655 --> 00:46:02.574
who it is you're burying.

00:46:18.006 --> 00:46:21.134
Groveling at my feet
wouldn't have been enough!

00:46:21.217 --> 00:46:22.468
What did she call me again?

00:46:22.552 --> 00:46:25.013
A middle-aged man acting like a diva?

00:46:25.096 --> 00:46:26.764
Unbelievable.

00:46:26.848 --> 00:46:28.141
But you are a middle-aged man.

00:46:28.224 --> 00:46:30.435
Nothing she said was wrong.

00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:33.563
Hey, it's the director!

00:46:34.314 --> 00:46:35.565
Hello, sir!

00:46:36.316 --> 00:46:39.027
Director Kim Cheol-ho, how are you?

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:44.198
Goodness, I've just been
waiting by the phone, hoping you'd call.

00:46:44.907 --> 00:46:46.826
Excuse me? Saturday?

00:46:46.909 --> 00:46:49.704
Saturday sounds great!

00:46:51.331 --> 00:46:52.206
Yes, sir!

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.335
I'll make a reservation
and get back to you, then.

00:46:55.418 --> 00:46:58.338
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:05.553
Are you home, Jeong-sin?

00:47:05.637 --> 00:47:07.513
Jeez, why is it raining so hard?

00:47:10.224 --> 00:47:12.852
Jeez, get cleaned up before you sit down!

00:47:12.935 --> 00:47:14.812
No, I'm too hungry.

00:47:14.896 --> 00:47:17.649
Why didn't you take a taxi
or buy an umbrella at a convenience store?

00:47:17.732 --> 00:47:20.109
You don't earn a thing,
but you're quick to tell me to spend mine.

00:47:20.193 --> 00:47:23.112
Don't you have a guy you can call
to bring you an umbrella?

00:47:23.196 --> 00:47:24.030
No.

00:47:25.114 --> 00:47:27.033
Do you know what's written on your face?

00:47:27.116 --> 00:47:28.868
-What?
-"I am solo."

00:47:29.744 --> 00:47:31.162
Quoi que l'on dise, on restera solo

00:47:31.245 --> 00:47:33.873
Quoi que l'on fasse, on restera solo
Solo, solo

00:47:33.956 --> 00:47:36.334
Hey, solo, have some kimchi stew.

00:47:40.088 --> 00:47:42.924
You're kind of a combination
of Gwang-su and Yeong-suk,

00:47:43.007 --> 00:47:44.092
so let's call you Gwang-suk.

00:47:46.761 --> 00:47:49.514
Jeong-sin, are you SSB?
Single Since Birth?

00:47:50.098 --> 00:47:52.016
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:53.685
Plenty.

00:47:53.768 --> 00:47:55.937
It's not something to be proud of.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.856
A normal person
would feel ashamed and get mad.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.233
There's no shame in that!

00:48:00.316 --> 00:48:02.026
You won't make it in the real world
with that mindset!

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.152
Not again.

00:48:04.153 --> 00:48:06.656
Hey, we have somewhere to go
in the morning.

00:48:06.739 --> 00:48:08.700
-Where?
-To pick up a TV.

00:48:10.076 --> 00:48:11.536
I knew it.

00:48:11.619 --> 00:48:13.871
-How much did you pay for this?
-I got it for free.

00:48:13.955 --> 00:48:15.623
Does it even work?

00:48:15.707 --> 00:48:18.126
Some people just give things away
instead of paying to trash them.

00:48:18.209 --> 00:48:21.212
I already checked and made sure it worked.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:25.425
Pass it to me!

00:48:25.508 --> 00:48:26.342
Get in there!

00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:28.761
-Move up!
-That's it!

00:48:52.535 --> 00:48:53.995
Yeah!

00:49:01.586 --> 00:49:02.670
Good job!

00:49:06.507 --> 00:49:08.217
Jeez, take a hint. The director is pissed.

00:49:09.051 --> 00:49:11.304
All right, let's do this!

00:49:11.387 --> 00:49:12.388
All right!

00:49:12.472 --> 00:49:13.848
Let's go, Director!

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.480
Yes!

00:49:21.564 --> 00:49:22.482
Nice job!

00:49:22.565 --> 00:49:24.275
Cut him off!

00:49:24.358 --> 00:49:25.777
Shoot the ball.

00:49:26.819 --> 00:49:28.321
Great shot!

00:49:28.821 --> 00:49:30.323
Excellent!

00:49:30.406 --> 00:49:31.240
I'm on him!

00:49:38.289 --> 00:49:42.585
Wow, how do you make such brilliant shots?

00:49:43.461 --> 00:49:45.463
I recently had ankle surgery,
but it seems fine.

00:49:45.546 --> 00:49:47.381
I haven't even gotten the stitches out.

00:49:47.465 --> 00:49:51.177
Director, you have such artistic flair,

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.804
you even kick the ball with style.

00:49:52.887 --> 00:49:56.307
It was totally an award-worthy shot!

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:58.267
Shoot like a star!

00:49:58.351 --> 00:50:00.728
Academy Award for Best Director shot!

00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:05.608
Director, enjoy a cold drink.

00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:06.567
WHEN A MAN FALLS IN LOVE

00:50:06.651 --> 00:50:08.402
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

00:50:08.486 --> 00:50:11.614
Thank you so much, Director.

00:50:12.573 --> 00:50:13.574
I'm sure a ton of actors

00:50:13.658 --> 00:50:16.035
-lined up for this.
-No, not at all.

00:50:17.078 --> 00:50:19.997
I've felt bad because Hyeon-jun
has a lot of hidden potential,

00:50:20.081 --> 00:50:23.584
but he was pigeonholed
as a detective for far too long.

00:50:25.419 --> 00:50:27.922
This project is a melodrama.

00:50:28.005 --> 00:50:29.340
Changing your public image is good,

00:50:29.423 --> 00:50:32.218
but as a viewer, I look forward to seeing

00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:34.136
a different side
to Lim Hyeon-jun's acting.

00:50:37.348 --> 00:50:38.724
Sir,

00:50:38.808 --> 00:50:41.394
I've been dying to do just that.

00:50:43.229 --> 00:50:46.399
I am truly grateful
that you reached out to me.

00:50:47.483 --> 00:50:50.194
The role of Sang-do
is a pretty good challenge, right?

00:50:51.445 --> 00:50:52.363
Sang-do?

00:50:53.155 --> 00:50:54.407
You mean, An Sang-do?

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:55.533
Yes, An Sang-do.

00:50:55.616 --> 00:50:57.743
But An Sang-do is a thug.

00:50:58.744 --> 00:51:00.121
That's right. A thug.

00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:03.457
You've played a detective, but not a thug.

00:51:05.209 --> 00:51:08.337
Hold on.
All that aside, Sang-do is the third…

00:51:09.046 --> 00:51:10.673
-The fourth thug?
-The fifth.

00:51:10.756 --> 00:51:12.008
The fifth thug?

00:51:12.758 --> 00:51:14.051
Yes, that's right.

00:51:14.135 --> 00:51:18.723
But he interacts with the lead a lot,
so he gets plenty of screen time.

00:51:18.806 --> 00:51:23.269
Wait, so did you call me here
to cast me as the fourth thug?

00:51:23.352 --> 00:51:24.729
I said the fifth thug.

00:51:27.148 --> 00:51:29.233
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

00:51:30.026 --> 00:51:33.988
Kang Pil-gu has left
such a strong impression

00:51:34.071 --> 00:51:36.866
that it doesn't match
the main character's artist image.

00:51:36.949 --> 00:51:39.076
But sir, you just said you felt bad for me

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.205
because I've been pigeonholed
as a detective for so long.

00:51:43.289 --> 00:51:44.457
That's why a thug is perfect.

00:51:45.374 --> 00:51:47.543
A rough and righteous thug
with a different vibe.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.881
What with the fan meeting behavior issue

00:51:51.964 --> 00:51:55.134
-and the sushi photo incident--
-But that was--

00:51:55.217 --> 00:51:57.136
Even ignoring that,
there's still the dating rumor.

00:51:57.887 --> 00:51:59.430
In any case, this project

00:52:00.097 --> 00:52:02.808
is a melodrama about a man
falling desperately in love

00:52:02.892 --> 00:52:05.811
with a woman who's losing her sight,
so an emotional connection is impossible.

00:52:05.895 --> 00:52:07.104
A thug is perfect for you.

00:52:21.744 --> 00:52:23.871
This looks so good.

00:52:25.957 --> 00:52:27.416
Let's see here.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:32.004
LIM HYEON-JUN AS KANG PIL-GU

00:52:32.755 --> 00:52:33.673
SKIP INTRO

00:52:34.215 --> 00:52:35.883
This had better be good.

00:52:39.387 --> 00:52:41.138
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU
EPISODE 1

00:53:04.036 --> 00:53:05.788
Time to take out the trash.

00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:07.039
Let's go!

00:53:08.499 --> 00:53:09.417
Not half bad.

00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:13.629
-Su-ji, I feel awful today!
-Yes?

00:53:14.588 --> 00:53:16.757
What am I supposed to do
at times like this?

00:53:16.841 --> 00:53:19.260
It sounds like you had a rough day.
What happened?

00:53:19.844 --> 00:53:22.013
I still feel twisted up inside.

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.684
Is there anything I can do for this?

00:53:26.767 --> 00:53:29.478
Maybe if you wash your hands in cold water
and brush your teeth,

00:53:29.562 --> 00:53:31.397
you'll feel a bit better.

00:53:34.442 --> 00:53:35.359
Really?

00:53:47.621 --> 00:53:48.789
Damn it!

00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:03.512
No, don't get hurt.

00:54:05.473 --> 00:54:07.433
That's it! Good job!

00:54:09.435 --> 00:54:11.062
Yeah!

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.940
Look behind you. Be careful!

00:54:19.528 --> 00:54:20.654
Nice work.

00:54:22.948 --> 00:54:24.533
They say you can't fix people.

00:54:25.117 --> 00:54:26.994
"They say you can't fix people."

00:54:27.078 --> 00:54:28.579
But I do.

00:54:28.662 --> 00:54:30.039
"But I do."

00:54:53.145 --> 00:54:56.899
What in the world gave you the idea
to publicly humiliate a reporter?

00:54:56.982 --> 00:55:00.861
She's going to be all over you now!

00:55:02.905 --> 00:55:04.990
What with the fan meeting behavior issue

00:55:05.074 --> 00:55:08.327
and the sushi photo incident
on National Liberation Day,

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:10.955
there's still the dating rumor.

00:55:11.038 --> 00:55:12.540
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

00:55:20.214 --> 00:55:21.090
That's crazy.

00:55:22.299 --> 00:55:23.384
That's it.

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:29.098
Holy shit, that was crazy.
