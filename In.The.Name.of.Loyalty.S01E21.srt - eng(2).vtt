00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.864
=Episode 21=

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.719
Gao Ji thinks my brother

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.159
hates my guts.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.280
He'd never believe I'd

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.320
bring him to the palace.

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:39.079
That's called hiding in plain sight.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.799
Now,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.200
Gao Ji is

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:49.840
focused on preparing the banquet,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.159
and meanwhile,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.992
searching the city for Shi Nan.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.880
This is when the defenses are weakest.

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:58.359
We must contact trusted officials now

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:59.240
to discuss our plan.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.640
However,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.719
no matter which path we take next,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.120
our priority now is to reclaim
the imperial seal.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.880
Exactly.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.760
The seal is the core of power.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.640
All memorials and military orders

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.200
require the seal and imperial rescript.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.840
If we get the seal,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.519
we essentially control the military.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.760
By then,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.959
officials currently vacillating

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.680
will recognize the shift in power.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.040
If Shi Yu reveals the seal,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.799
Gao Ji will lose

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.599
his legitimate authority
to deploy troops.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.959
Gao Ji values

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.400
his reputation most.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.920
If he knows I possess the imperial seal,

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.480
he won't dare act recklessly.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.319
He might even

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.519
lose his composure.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.760
But Gao Ji already knows

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.680
you won't willingly be his puppet.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.920
Therefore,

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.920
you must appear weak recently,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.239
and let him think

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.280
you know limits,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.808
and will stay out of his way

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.992
under his control.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.359
That's right.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840
We'll lull Gao Ji into complacency,

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.760
and also urgently locate
the imperial seal's hiding place.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.680
(Minister Yin,)

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.680
(gather all officials loyal to me)

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.759
(to stage a performance in the court.)

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.639
(General Yan,)

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.120
(to advance steadily,)

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.520
(I can only ask you all)

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.520
(to endure for now.)

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.896
(To destroy someone,)

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.639
(drive them mad first.)

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.439
(I'll be more obedient
to the Prince Regent than ever.)

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.599
(Of course,)

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.360
(pain is necessary.)

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:51.680
(I'll detain)

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.240
(my trusted aides personally)

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.280
(to protect them)

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:55.960
(and preserve our strength.)

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.080
(It pains me,)

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.280
(but please endure a little longer.)

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.560
(Your Majesty, you've endured all this)

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.000
(for a just court and a peaceful realm.)

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.439
(I would die a thousand times
without regret.)

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.840
(Everyone,)

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.039
(stick to the plan.)

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.840
(Yang Youxing, Minister of Rites,)

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.919
(has disregarded court laws)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.479
(and abused his power.)

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.280
(Imprison him immediately,)

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.400
(pending trial and sentencing.)

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.159
Shi Yu!

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.520
You heartless tyrant!

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.800
Move!

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.840
What a tyrant!

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.199
My lord.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.040
Why so many?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.079
Only one is true.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.879
What now?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680
I won't disturb your rest then.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.079
I'll come tomorrow.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.720
You may return first.

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.079
It appears

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.720
the only time
we can access the real seal

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.240
is when Gao Ji carries it.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.879
But if we try to steal it,

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.000
Gao Ji would discover us

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.319
before we could escape.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.120
My lord,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.720
His Majesty has arrived.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.399
Your Majesty, you visit so late.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.759
Is there any urgent business?

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.000
Lord Father,

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.600
I was preparing
my wedding banquet speech.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.800
There are a few phrases

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.560
I wish to consult you about.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.600
Your Majesty,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.680
how about I pay a visit to your chamber

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.639
after tomorrow's court session?

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:24.640
It will only take a moment.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.376
Lord Father.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.319
Prince Xiyou's wife

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.480
is my mother's cousin.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.040
Is this form of address appropriate?

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.839
Yes.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.120
That is the proper address.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.800
What about this?

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.920
Are these addresses proper?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.920
The same.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.480
There are also a few details I'd...

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.120
Your Majesty,

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.160
this seems rather presumptuous.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.759
Today's advice from you

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.160
exceeds ten years of study.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:13.279
Guidance is appreciated.
Please rest early.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.519
Now Gao Ji has left the capital
to prepare the banquet,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.559
we'll give him a grand welcome
upon his return.

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:46.176
(The 26th day of the 10th lunar month)

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.919
Soldiers, heed my command!

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.200
From now on,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.519
the Imperial Guards,

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:53.399
Palace Guards,

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:55.399
Eastern Cavalry, and Western Cavalry

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.080
will be commanded by General Yan.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:01.960
The South Hawks Army will be led
by Deputy Commander Zhang Mao.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.039
Tiger Wing Army will be led
by Deputy Commander Qin Bingkun.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.679
All assume your posts immediately.

00:09:22.944 --> 00:09:27.392
(Memorial tablet of Pingxiang people)

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:28.600
My lord, we...

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:32.200
What's happening?

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:34.919
By imperial decree,

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:36.440
Minister Chen Huan

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.559
is convicted

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.039
of embezzling military funds.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.960
Exiled to the frontier,
effective immediately.

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:43.320
Go!

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.720
Go!

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.288
(Memorial tablets)

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.919
By imperial decree,

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:04.000
Shen Kuo, the West General,
who cares for the nation and its people,

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.360
is hereby cleared of all charges

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.440
and reinstated to his former post.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.919
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:19.440
I, Shi Yu.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.360
Shi Nan.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:23.120
Cheng Ge.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.480
We shall engrave your grievances
in my heart,

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.159
- reclaim the realm,
- reclaim the realm,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.639
- and bring peace to the land.
- and bring peace to the land.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.200
Stop! Stop the carriage!

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.360
Stop! Stop the carriage!

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.799
My lord. My lord.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.879
Why aren't you at the palace?

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:37.679
Why are you here?

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:39.799
The Western Cavalry, South Hawks Army

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.080
and Tiger Wing Army
all have new commanders.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.639
Even the Imperial Guards,

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:44.279
Palace Guards,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.279
and Eastern Cavalry

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.679
all answer to General Yan now.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.440
Nonsense!

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:52.120
I still hold the imperial seal.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.799
How could they obey?

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:55.600
Th-They said

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.759
the decree came directly
from His Majesty,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.039
complete with imperial seal
and imperial rescript.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.399
Please wait.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.480
You worthless fool.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.160
Has one day apart

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.559
made you forget me?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.440
Your Highness,

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.480
without His Majesty's order,
no one may enter.
