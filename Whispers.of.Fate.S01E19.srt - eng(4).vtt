[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.940
[Episode 19]

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.039
Yan.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.190
You falsely accused me
of being Yique Yinyang,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.330
watching me being hunted by everyone.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.770
Are you happy about it?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.560
Of course.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.590
This is the happiest thing

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.720
that's happened to me in these 4 years.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.700
Watching your lies being exposed.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.310
Letting everyone

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.789
see your true face.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.509
Lici, look.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.180
I was right.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.910
Peach blossoms.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.560
What a coincidence.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.710
Just like the day I killed you.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.800
So,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.530
your revenge is over.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.620
Are you going to kill me now?

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.650
I've come to terms with it.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.960
A menace like you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.710
should be killed outright.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.900
Every day you live

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.930
gives you a chance to bewitch others

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.960
and a chance

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.980
to continue weaving your enormous lies.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.400
Yan,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.970
have you thought that

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.560
if I die

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.930
and the Divine Inquiry Platform falls,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.460
your people in Fengliu Shop

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.890
will all perish with it?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.280
Are you really

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.280
that foolish?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.910
Tang Lici,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.310
you've grown so merciful

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.520
you'd even save people

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.579
from Fengliu Shop?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.200
Are you imitating Fang Zhou?

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.890
Your hypocritical face

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.360
is utterly disgusting.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.960
Today,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.430
even if I have to die here,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.280
I'll take you with me.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.370
This is Fang Zhou's heart crystal.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120
He's still alive.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.940
Yan.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.370
During the Battle of Tiandu Peak,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.560
Fang Zhou was wounded by Yique Yinyang,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.220
damaging his heart meridian.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.350
H-how is he?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.310
Lici!

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.750
Save him.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.750
I can't.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.770
I really can't do anything.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.740
I've gone through all the medical books.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.600
If we can't remove the evil energy

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.270
that Yique Yinyang

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.480
left in his body,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.600
then once

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.800
his damaged heart meridian is treated,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.240
it will flare up and only get worse.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.270
Lici.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.210
What are you talking about?

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.990
Didn't I tell you
to lie down and not move?

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.480
Who allowed you to get out of bed?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.040
What?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.200
I just want something to eat.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.700
Does that count as moving?

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.190
I'm hungry.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.600
I'll go make some food.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.000
Everyone, wait a moment.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.040
Now,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.520
my heart and lungs are decaying.

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:54.960
It's an old wound

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.810
from Yique Yinyang back then.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.430
No one can heal it.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.270
At worst, when the time comes,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.190
you can cry for me

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.160
properly.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.040
Let's eat.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.730
Practice the Rebirth Scroll.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.400
Lici,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.030
do you know what you're saying?

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.120
How do you

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.920
know about this evil technique?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.510
I forgot.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.360
You said you forgot

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.750
where you came from,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.640
what your name is,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.300
and why you know martial arts,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.900
and now you say
you know the Rebirth Scroll?

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.120
Tang Lici,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.630
everything you can't or don't want to say,

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.230
you claim you've forgotten!

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.070
Alright,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.750
Yan.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.040
Legend says except for Yique Yinyang,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.360
everyone who tried to practice
the Rebirth Scroll

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.420
exploded and died.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.580
After Yique Yinyang's death,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.730
the Rebirth Scroll was lost long ago.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.880
Its only use

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.560
is to pass one's power

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.960
to another before death.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.640
You want Senior
to practice this evil technique?

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.040
What are you really up to?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.950
Enough.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.940
Everyone has their own fate.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.310
I won't

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.170
practice such an evil technique.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.320
Evil technique?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.480
Good.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.840
Evil technique.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.950
Lici.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.070
There's a section in the Rebirth Scroll

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.530
called "Power Exchange."

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.870
Two people with equal strength

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.470
can not only exchange powers

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.000
but also transfer the evil energy

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.200
from one to the other.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.800
Later,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.380
I finally convinced Fang Zhou

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.950
to practice this technique.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.430
No.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.860
I don't want it!

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.220
I don't want it!

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.710
I don't want a Zhoudi Tower without you!

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.950
Listen to me.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.850
Practice the Rebirth Scroll,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.540
use it for power exchange,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.800
and transfer the evil energy in you

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.680
to me.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.640
My body is different.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.930
I can heal myself.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.730
This is the only way.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.240
The only way!

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.360
Enough.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.870
I am Fang Zhou.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:21.830
I will not

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.690
practice such an evil technique.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.240
Evil technique?

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.800
Evil technique.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.710
Then am I, who can use

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.549
this evil technique, a monster?

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.080
No.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.140
Of course not.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.440
You are certainly not a monster!

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.169
Then why can't you practice it?

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.910
Why?

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.440
Why?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.910
Why?

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.960
Why?

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.050
Why can't you practice it?

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.790
Why?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.240
Alright.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.200
You agreed?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.450
But you have to promise me first

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.600
that

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.200
Yan and Fu

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.730
must never know about this.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:39.630
Okay.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.420
After all, the Rebirth Scroll

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:44.970
is

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.060
closely connected to Yique Yinyang.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.910
Besides,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.890
I was not completely confident

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.630
that it would fully heal him.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.750
So,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.510
Fang Zhou and I agreed

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.180
to send you and Zhumei away on the day

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.780
we performed the technique.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.360
That day,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.480
we performed the technique alone.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.940
It went smoothly at first.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.720
I almost succeeded.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.360
But then...

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.150
What happened?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.150
I didn't expect

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.080
that you and Fu would come back suddenly.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.180
Are you saying we ruined your plan

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.510
by coming back?

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.440
Yan,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.650
because of the feud between the two of us,

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.770
jianghu is now drenched in blood.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.650
You used to be a healer, a kind soul.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.070
Falling into darkness
shouldn't have been your fate.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.560
Just now,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.510
you already sensed

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.280
that Fang Zhou's heart crystal

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.260
is inside me.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.010
And I hid his body

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.750
in Zhoudi Tower,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.750
preserving it in Biluo Palace's

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.150
Immortal Crystal Coffin.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.810
His essence

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.720
and vitality are intact.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.480
As long as we use the Rebirth Scroll

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.480
to restore them,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.110
Fang Zhou

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.030
can be revived.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.200
Yan,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.120
give me back the other half

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.080
of the Rebirth Scroll.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.140
Let's bring Fang Zhou back together.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.870
Yan,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.790
we're running out of time.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.600
Yan!

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.320
Tang Lici

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.480
is Yique Yinyang.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.910
He's extremely cunning,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.420
best at twisting the truth

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.870
and beguiling others.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.520
Don't believe his words.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.210
Trust your own eyes.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.660
Power Exchange Technique?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.390
Yique Yinyang,

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.750
this is how you tricked Fang Zhou,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.200
using the last of his life

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.530
to help you cultivate the Rebirth Scroll

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.150
and repair your body

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.210
damaged in the Battle of Tiandu Peak.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.510
Why do you still

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.710
refuse to believe me?

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:52.840
Lici,

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.480
the other half of the Rebirth Scroll

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.680
is right here with me.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.520
Come and get it.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.240
Lici,

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.680
this Soul‑Devouring Gu

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.280
was bred especially for you!

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.930
Blood Begonias,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.240
bloom!

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.650
Lici,

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.840
it all began with the peach blossoms.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.750
Let it all end

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.390
with the peach blossoms.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.750
Liu Yan,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.590
I've been holding back this whole time,

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.480
because this wasn't your fault

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.960
at the start.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.450
But you've sunk deep into obsession,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.720
and now your hands are stained with sin.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.590
Tang Lici rarely makes mistakes.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.910
But with you,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.470
I made a grave mistake.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.720
It was I

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.480
who allowed your downfall.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.080
Now that you're this corrupted,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.560
breaking you

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.109
can give you a fresh start.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.160
Tang Lici!

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.060
The sea of karma shatters,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.240
with the sound of the heavenly drum!

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:16.970
Heaven spares none!

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.569
Celestial Quelling Melody!

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.200
One more inch forward

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.030
and your qin will be smashed to dust.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.590
Before that happens,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.070
I'll turn you to ashes!

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.500
Assassins wait for a single flaw
to strike!

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.160
Who do you think you are?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.700
Martial Realm.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.640
Blood Moon Heart Slayer!

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.910
Yan,

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320
how's his injury?

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.110
He's out of danger.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.070
Senior,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.820
this little monster looks pitiful.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.960
Why don't we

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.830
let him stay?

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.670
That's my plan too.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.590
Monster!

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.070
Shen Langhun!

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.810
Die!

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.920
You didn't want to kill Liu Yan.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.470
But you didn't stop me from killing him.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.030
That was enough.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.920
Mr. Tang!

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.590
Mr. Tang!

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.000
Mr. Tang!

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.310
Mr. Tang!

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.070
Shen!

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.160
He's not here!

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.920
Foxy Tang!

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.680
Mr. Tang!

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.240
Mr. Tang!

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.790
Did you find him?

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.350
No.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.920
Mr. Tang!

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.510
What about over there?

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.270
Mr. Tang!

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.000
Chi!

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.720
Chi.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.350
They found Shen.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.750
He said he saw Mr. Tang

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.710
before he chased Liu Yan.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400
Where is Foxy Tang?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.200
Haven't found him yet.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.510
Mr. Tang!

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.160
Where is Shei?

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.960
Mr. Tang!

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.030
Isn't Miss Shei

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.070
with you?

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.070
Mr. Tang!

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.000
Mr. Tang!

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.680
Mr. Tang!

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.720
Mr. Tang,

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.630

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.560

Chi Yun.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.390
You're awake?

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.330
How are you feeling?

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.410
Are you alright?

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.280
I'm fine.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.840
Did you bring me back?

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:39.790
It wasn't me.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.110
It was Shei.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.270
She carried you on her back
through half the forest

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.920
before she finally found someone to help.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.590
Shei?

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.510
How long was I unconscious?

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.240
About 3 days.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.240
Oh, right.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.550
Guess who's here?

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.590
Shao Yanping
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.390
He came to Biluo Palace himself?

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:01.920
Yes.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.290
Put your clothes on.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.720
I'll let them know you're awake.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.200
Chi Yun.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.580
Thank you.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.150
Don't mention it.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.640
Mr. Tang.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.400
You're awake?

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.720
Do you know

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.540
you almost injured your tendons?

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.350
I have experience.
I wouldn't make that mistake.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.420
Are you proud

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.850
of having that kind of experience?

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.510
I told you

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.310
never

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:04.710
to save me that way again.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.810
Where is Shen Langhun?

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.740
Shen is out of danger.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.830
He's resting in another room.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.760
Palace Chief Wanyu has sent people

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.640
to thoroughly search

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.570
Qingshan Cliff and Mount Mengxue.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.080
Neither they nor Shen

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.750
found Liu Yan's body.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.570
He might have escaped.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.330
Did I ask about Liu Yan?

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.550
I guessed

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.980
you'd want to know.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.350
Back in Yuxiao Cavern,

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.350
I wanted to ask you

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.320
why you always try to please me.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:20.680
I...

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.590
never tried to please anyone.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.360
It's only when I'm by your side

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.920
that I feel useful.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.730
Do you know how many people

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.830
spend their whole lives in confusion,

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.000
questioning themselves

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.200
why they were even born into this world?

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.310
Do you know how many,
at the moment of death,

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.720
still struggle to find a reason

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.920
for their existence,

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.590
just to feel

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.040
they didn't live in vain?

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.690
Being alive is the best reason.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.640
Living

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.160
can be easy

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.400
and simple.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.680
You don't need any reason to stay alive.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.240
I used to think so too.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.680
But I don't know any martial arts,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.010
have no special skills,

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.490
drift from place to place,
and am of no use.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.440
But why did Heaven

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:05.790
grant me

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.450
such a special constitution?

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.840
It wasn't until I met you

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.680
that I understood

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.510
this is my purpose.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.550
You can save the world,

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.640
and I can save you.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.030
Save the world?

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:23.680
No.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.100
I have no interest in that.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.480
As for you,

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.400
if you want to follow me,

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.480
then do so.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.770
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.620
Greetings,

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.340
Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.630
and...

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.630
Master Shao
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.790
Mr. Tang.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.900
Your reputation doesn't do you justice—

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.270
You truly have extraordinary bearing.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.000
Are you feeling better now, Mr. Tang?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.200
I'm fine.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.440
Master Shao,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.570
you've come all the way to Biluo Palace

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.110
for the alliance, haven't you?

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.440
While you were recovering,

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.240
Palace Chief Wanyu and I

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.440
reached a general agreement.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.160
But there are

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.640
still some key points

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.350
that require your advice.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.960
First, thank you

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.590
for saving the Divine Inquiry Platform
and Biluo Palace.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.920
Can that offset my crime

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.730
of stealing the Immortal Crystal Coffin?

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.680
If you had cared about that crime,

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.680
you wouldn't have dared
to steal it in the first place.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.610
One less trouble is a good thing anyway.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.570
What else?

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.030
This is a fragment of the stone

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:57.550
Qiaoyi Qiankun used

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.270
to break through the Divine Inquiry Stone.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.550
It seems to share the same origin

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.960
as the Divine Inquiry Stone

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.030
and the silver bracelet on your wrist.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.360
Have you ever seen these patterns before?

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.640
Not only are this fragment
and the bracelet of the same origin,

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.300
but I too am from the same place

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.480
as Yique Yinyang.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.000
We come from a place beyond Shenzhou

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.680
called Tianren Realm.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.830
Since I arrived in Shenzhou,

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.510
Tianren Realm and Shenzhou

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.990
have been separated by a void,

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.850
with no connection between them.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.270
No wonder you're so extraordinary.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.550
But why

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.440
did you two come to Shenzhou?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.590
I think

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.360
he must have escaped

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.350
just like me.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.510
Our homeland

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.200
is not a pleasant place.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.240
Mr. Tang,

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.030
why did you openly admit your relationship

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.310
with Yique Yinyang?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.680
Because

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.790
this fragment
was likely used by Fengliu Shop

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.720
to recruit Qiaoyi Qiankun.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.200
But I'm certain

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.120
Liu Yan doesn't know

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.360
about Tianren Realm.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.270
So

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.490
behind Fengliu Shop,

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.920
there must be someone

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.350
connected to Yique Yinyang from back then.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.270
If you ask me,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.640
this isn't a bad thing.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.040
Since Fengliu Shop

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.650
is related to Yique Yinyang,

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.370
this matter will surely attract
His Majesty's attention.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.360
As long as Biluo Palace

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.030
helps eliminate Fengliu Shop,

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.350
His Majesty will surely allow

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.880
Biluo Palace to return
to the imperial court.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.830
It seems you already know

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.720
about my promise to Biluo Palace.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.680
We should thank you for securing

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.310
Biluo Palace as an ally
for the Sword Alliance.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.340
I've put in so much effort.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:45.640
Master Shao,

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.290
all I get is a thank you?

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.160
What else do you want?

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.890
Master Cheng, don't overthink it.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.770
I have always admired

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.830
Master Shao,

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:56.940
and years ago even considered

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.940
joining the Sword Alliance myself.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.330
But unfortunately...

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.250
Dream on.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.830
In the case of the fall of Zhoudi Tower,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.310
you are still under suspicion.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.720
How could you possibly join
the Sword Alliance?

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.850
Master Cheng, if you have no evidence,

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.690
you mustn't make wild guesses.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.720
With a powerful enemy before us,

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.790
resisting Fengliu Shop

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.320
should be our top priority.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.590
If I can join the Sword Alliance

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.310
and the Sword Alliance works together
with the court,

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.970
it would be the best solution.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.160
Master Shao,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640
what do you think?

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.550
I think it makes sense.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.510
Fengliu Shop
is coming at us with full force.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.200
We should unite all forces.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.880
Palace Chief, what do you think?

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.440
Since Mr. Tang

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.700
has decided to assist the Sword Alliance

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.540
in eliminating Fengliu Shop,

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.920
I'm sure

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.440
he already has plans

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.710
for how to act going forward.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.600
I agree

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.780
with you.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.280
In that case,

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.390
the Central Plains Sword Alliance
is honored

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.280
to welcome Mr. Tang as our Guest of Honor.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.650
Guest of Honor?

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.950
You planned this in advance, right?

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.310
If you insist,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.780
I cannot refuse.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.400
Greetings, Leader.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.690
Call me Godfather.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.170
Godfather.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.790
Are you happy to see me?

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.490
No, I'm not.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.900
I failed in the mission

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.410
of Fengliu Shop.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.550
Why did you fail?

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.800
Qiaoyi Qiankun

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.870
had already

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.130
broken the Nine Stars Dragon Formation.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.230
But somehow, Tang Lici

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.230
managed to

00:33:58.510 --> 00:33:59.830
push the Divine Inquiry Platform

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.360
back to its original place.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:02.800
Even Master

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.200
has disappeared.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.030
Master...

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.409
hasn't returned?

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.110
No.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.030
Xiaohong is frantic with worry.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.889
She searched around Qingshan Cliff
for a long time.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.409
What do you think

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.710
we should name it?

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.000
Is this cat

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.670
your new pet?

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.360
Not yet.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.440
Master said that

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.199
if it doesn't have a name,

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.960
I'm just feeding it,

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:35.989
so it doesn't count as my pet.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.650
And if I'm just feeding it,

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.389
I don't have the right to kill it.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:43.800
Godfather, just name it

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.020
whatever you think of.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.540
Whether you call her Tang Lici

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.030
or Liu Yan,

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.000
it's up to you.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.210
I'll take my leave.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.110
Does that chess friend of yours...

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.160
still need to exist?

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:11.910
I understand.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.350
She's too young and incompetent.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.110
Coming from the lowest class,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.220
she's also shortsighted.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.430
I cannot lose.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.340
I must prove to Master.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.590
The life of a fallen disciple
of Fengliu Shop

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.120
can be exchanged for merit.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:36.880
By then...

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.480
Here!

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.590
Those sword masters

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.250
will no longer look down on me.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:45.710
Senior!

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.630
I'm willing to join
the Central Plains Sword Alliance!

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.560
Please spare me!

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.280
It's too late.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.590
You want to eliminate us completely,
don't you?

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.480
Then I'll send all these people to hell

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.590
along with you!

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.950
Master Puzhu.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.780
Your heart is clouded.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.610
You don't belong here.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.620
Master Puzhu,

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.470
I was only eager

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.840
to eliminate the scum from Fengliu Shop

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.970
as soon as possible.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.630
I had no other intention.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.280
So,

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.170
you don't think
you've done anything wrong?

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.440
I know I was wrong.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.330
He had already given up resisting,

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.220
so I shouldn't have forced him
into despair.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.090
I nearly doomed myself.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.710
Without eliminating your inner demon,

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.150
you'll end up at a disadvantage.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.750
Well then,

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.550
you should leave this place for now.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:41.960
Yes.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.630
In the battle at Biluo Palace,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.000
Mr. Tang Lici defeated Fengliu Shop,

00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.330
showing unmatched brilliance and courage.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:00.680
[Wanhua Hall]

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.080
You're a true outstanding hero of jianghu.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.280
I invite you to serve

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.210
as the Guest of Honor
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.650
to clear your name

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.400
and restore your honor.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.770
Mount Cloud
is truly magnificent and majestic.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.230
Is anyone here?

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:29.710
Shen,

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.130
today is the 15th of the month, right?

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.670
Yes.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.690
So I'm not wrong.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.750
Biluo Palace kept us to heal,

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.530
and Shao Yanping left first with Shei.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:39.280
We agreed to meet today

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.780
at the entrance of the Sword Alliance.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.490
He said he had arranged everything.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.510
Shouldn't there be

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.840
a grand welcome,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.600
with crowds lining the way?

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.320
Why is there not even

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:48.920
a doorman,

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.620
and the gate is closed?

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.000
Foxy Tang,

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.360
why do you always get turned away
wherever you go?

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.150
Chi Yun,

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.190
when visiting someone else's territory,

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.440
you should stay low-profile,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440
follow the rules,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.440
and show respect.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.880
I, Tang Lici, along with Shen Langhun

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.770
and my aide Chi Yun,
am here to pay my respects.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.670
Sword Masters,
please honor us with a meeting.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.240
It seems they don't welcome us.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.000
You must be Mr. Tang, who recently

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.890
made a name for himself in jianghu

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.840
for turning the tide at Biluo Palace.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.760
That's me,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.920
Tang Lici.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.360
And these two

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.000
must be Chi Yun, called "Cloud"

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.360
in the underworld,

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.660
and Shen Langhun, the top assassin

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:24.960
of the Fallen Shisan Tower.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.550
Truly an honor.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.920
Not bad, showing some insight.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.800
I didn't know

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.480
that our

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.280
grand and righteous Wanhua Hall

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.510
could let

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.280
an assassin who kills for money

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.030
walk in so freely.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.620
Haven't any of you killed before?

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:42.820
Ridiculous.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.650
How can one rule jianghu without killing?

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.130
We're different from you.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.670
Indeed. Different.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.800
I take money

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.760
because I'm worth it.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:54.810
Mr. Tang!

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.010
Control the people you bought!

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.800
A righteous sect?

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:02.870
Don't be hasty, Shen.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:05.880
Shen

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.230
is here as a friend

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.000
of mine.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.590
He can say

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:11.430
whatever he wants to say.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.440
Mr. Tang is a guest from afar.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.550
Our Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:18.670
values etiquette.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.670
Let's first hear

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.630
what Mr. Tang has to say.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.450
I've long heard

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.400
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance
is the foremost righteous sect.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.130
I've admired it for a long time.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.350
Being invited

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.710
by Sword Master Shao

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.040
to serve as a Guest of Honor this time

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.630
is truly an honor.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.990
How can he put it so properly?

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.010
According to Sword Master Shao,

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.630
Mr. Tang's golden eyes and forehead mark

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:44.880
are different from

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880
Yique Yinyang's.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.000
In the battle at Biluo Palace, Mr. Tang

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.800
thwarted Fengliu Shop's scheme

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.630
and helped form an alliance between
the Sword Alliance and Biluo Palace.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.760
He has Master Cheng,

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.550
Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.400
and Master Shao all testifying to this.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.550
So the matter
of the golden eyes and forehead mark

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.350
must be Fengliu Shop's slander.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.890
Are you the disciple

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.480
of Taoist Healer,

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.590
Qingming Sword, Ji Wuyou,

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.880
Master Ji?

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.110
I'm "Free My Clear Mind,"

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:09.710
Ji Wuyou.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:12.650
Nice to meet you, Mr. Tang.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.760
If you ask me,

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.200
among these people,

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.160
you're the most reasonable one.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.760
Are there

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.850
any extra seats here?

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.160
It's so tiring to stand while talking.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.840
What we mean is,

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.400
there is no seat for Mr. Tang

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.840
in Wanhua Hall.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.000
Sirs,

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.320
please leave.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.230
You...

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.660
"Qinghong Divine Sword," Master Shang,

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.560
"Qifeng Iron Brush," Master Xiao,

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.630
"Nine-Turn Divine Arrow," Shangguan Fei,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.590
and "Yunhai Dongling," Mr. Jiang.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.060
Then you must be...

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.150
Snake Lord,

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.400
Mr. Pu.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.360
How thorough of you

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.750
to investigate everyone here

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.920
so completely.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.360
That's because you're famous.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.510
Who in jianghu

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.280
doesn't know you?

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:08.400
I believe

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.670
you are not people

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.530
who cannot tell right from wrong.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.880
You must have your own reasons

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.550
for rejecting me,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.440
right?

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:18.840
Mr. Tang,
you just joined the Sword Alliance

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.230
and dared to demand
the position of Guest of Honor.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.960
Isn't that a bit arrogant?

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:24.860
You want the authority
of the Sword Alliance,

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.990
but you don't want to follow its rules.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.330
We cannot agree to that.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.550
Sword Masters,

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.030
are you saying

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.320
that I am unworthy

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.980
of serving as Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance?

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.910
Or are you saying

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.330
that the Sword Alliance

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.590
doesn't deserve a Guest of Honor?

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.070
Mr. Tang, since entering jianghu,

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:48.710
your actions

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.920
have proven

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:51.190
that you're skilled in martial arts

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:52.590
and brilliant in strategy.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:53.960
Rejecting you

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.070
might make us seem

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.070
narrow-minded,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.480
unable to accept
a rising talent in jianghu.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.630
But Mr. Tang, who usually ignores rules

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.150
and comes and goes freely,

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.390
now suddenly wants
to join the Sword Alliance

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.250
to serve for the peace of jianghu—

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.670
isn't that suspicious?

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.320
If I join the Sword Alliance

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:11.840
with no ambition

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.760
and willingly stay under others,

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.760
won't that be even more suspicious?

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:19.110
Since I want to be the Guest of Honor,

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:19.880
you should feel

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.320
reassured.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.630
Doesn't this precisely prove

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.730
that I am willing

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.510
to take responsibility

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:27.920
for the Sword Alliance?

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.880
Fengliu Shop
has already thrown jianghu into chaos.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.960
Especially at this moment,

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.760
we cannot have disorder
within the Sword Alliance.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.550
We cannot accept

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:35.320
a dangerous person

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.440
who cannot be controlled.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.280
So,

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.190
are you saying

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:41.960
that the Sword Alliance

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.920
can resist Fengliu Shop

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.000
