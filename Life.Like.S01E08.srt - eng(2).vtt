What are you doing here?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.150
Let's get them out of here first.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.120
How do you have the key?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280
I'll explain later.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.440
Senior…

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.700
Are you all right?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.520

Let's go.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.640
Take that chest to the front line too.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.480
It can be traded for guns,

food,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.680
Thank you, Senior,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.920
and the pretty lady.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.900
We'll make sure
to take down more of those devils.

Senior,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
once we take this step,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.880
there's no turning back.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.160
Actually,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.580
it's brought us closer.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.120
Be careful.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.680

is a scumbag after all.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.080
Get in the car.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.120

come from?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.440
What?

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.760
Are you giving it to me?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.680
Don't you have

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.840
something to say to me?

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.360
I do.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.200
I've got plenty to say.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.840
What do you want to hear first?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.040
I'm returning what's yours.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.120
I don't get what you mean,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.080
but you must be exhausted today.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.120
You should

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.400
go back and get some rest.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.560
I won't see you off.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
What? But…

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.680

You're treating me?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.200
I hope this isn't a trap.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.560
Are you going to watch me get changed?

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.480
I suppose I could,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.680
