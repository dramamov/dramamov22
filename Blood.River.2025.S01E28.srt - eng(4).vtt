Everything about this seems off.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.260
He probably figured

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.740
the food here wasn't to his taste,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.260
so he went to find lighter dishes.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.100
In Jin City,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.540
where can you find light dishes?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.020
Perhaps

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.900
the Tang Clan?

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.380
Why did he go there?

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.910
You guys came here

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.180
to negotiate a deal with us.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.120
If you guys are visiting Tang Clan,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.900
the deal between us

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.820
is off!

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.660
You really think we're taking this negotiation seriously?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.220
Now that Xuewei has returned,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.610
the negotiation

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.380
is off.

You!

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.290
Didn't the intel you guys gathered inform you

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.890
that I wasn't a credible individual?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.500
I never said

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.730
that I would keep my promise.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.100
Patriarch,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.820

We wish to get out of the dark and nefarious Blood River.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.290
But judging from Tang Clan's current situation,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.780
it's just like Blood River.

Isn't that Tang Tianlu?

If we fight him,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.730
the commotion will definitely

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.730
attract all of their members here.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.690
We have to lure them away somehow.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.220
you should let me

check your pulse.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.340
This toxin

is the same as the toxin in Xuewei's body.

Could it be that she's in trouble?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.220
She was taken away by Night Crow before this.

I knew it.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.660
Although my martial niece harbored

sinister thoughts,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.660
she's exceptionally intelligent.

A near-perfect toxic beauty

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.490
was in her hands.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.170
I suppose she could extract the toxin

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.810
within her

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.290
and use it for other purposes.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.730
This toxin is difficult to neutralize.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.140
This pill will suppress it for now.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.250
I'll neutralize the poison for you

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.580
once we leave this place.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.580
Thank you, Miss Bai.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.410
Miss Bai,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.610
do you have a way to rescue Tang Lianyue?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.260
The Frostmoon Cocoon, huh?

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.170
I have an idea.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.610
How should we rescue him?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.460
I'll try using Ember.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.250
I suppose snakes devour cocoons, right?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.490
I think so.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.780
What kind of snake is Ember?

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.100
A Phoenix Flame Serpent.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.020
This is Ember.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.260
Ember isn't as obedient as Green.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.250
It knew that my calling would surely mean trouble.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.900
That's why it isn't willing to work.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.850
That's more like it.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.810
Get to work.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.370
I think the room

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.700
isn't as cold now.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.700
Yeah.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.410
And,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.730
it's getting warmer by the second.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.290
If we have the Celestial Sea Flame Spider,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.580
Tang Lianyue

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.850
would've returned to normal by now.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.350
Although Ember

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.560
is a rare flame-attribute mystical snake,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.110
it'll take at least four hours

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.740
for it

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.460
to melt all of the ice here.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.660
He'll return to normal eventually.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.050
However,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.780
he won't regain consciousness just yet.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.100
It's a shame

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.700
that you guys won't have the time to do so.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.890
You're already dead

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.460

Miss Bai,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.530
please examine him.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.340
I didn't do that.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.420
It'll take at least half an hour

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.580
for ordinary people

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.580
to regain their movements in this situation.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.250
Miss Bai, you were referring to ordinary people.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.300
But he's Tang Lianyue.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.340
Yes.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.580
I'm Tang Lianyue.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.850
You're finally awake.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.370
Never would I have imagined

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.220
that the ones to come and save me

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.010
would be you all.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.950
What do you mean by that?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.950
Shouldn't you think of me at the first time

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.100
when you were ambushed?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.130
It's you?

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.230
What do you mean by that?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.650
Who am I?

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.060
Mu Yumo.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.010
He answered that directly, huh?

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.340
That was pretty surprising.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.370
Yeah.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.820
He's Tang Lianyue after all.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.770
Martial Uncle,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.300
I want to know why you're doing this.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.490
You guys support Tang Linghuang.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.700
We do not want

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.460
Tang Linghuang

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.420
to become the next grand master.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.770
But the address of Tang Clan's Wanbao Tower

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.940
is only known to

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.220
Grand Master Tang, Senior Brother, and me.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.730
Is that why you guys

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.850
trapped us here

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.060
without killing us?

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.610

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.730
all heaven-rank hidden weapons of the Tang Clan.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.940
Without them,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.320
it'll be difficult for Tang Clan

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.070
to maintain its position

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.060
in the martial world.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.610
Although you're free now,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.130
Tang Linghuang and Tang Lian

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.730
are still in our hands.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.460
If you try anything funny,

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.130
he was also released

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.090
on purpose.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.410
He's resting in the medicine room now.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.460
I came here to notify you all.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.060
It seems like the work of martial niece of mine.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.460
They took Tang Linghuang away

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.740
because his body

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.370
was the perfect medicinal vessel.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.700
Later, I'll give him a diagnosis

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.610
at Tang Clan.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.780
Please send him back

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.190
to Medicine King Valley after that.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.090
Thank you.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.610
Is that all from Tang Lianyue?

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.780
I'm sure you all are here

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.510
for other purposes.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.090
And, Grand Master Tang hasn't returned from his trip.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.740
Neither Vice Master Tang nor Lianyue is around as well.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.020
If you need anything,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.740
you may discuss it with me.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.740
Discuss it with you?

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.890
Who do you think you are?

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.900
Do you think you have the right to speak with us?

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.980
Patriarch,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.300
what do you mean by that?

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.540
I feel the same as Changhe.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.170
Who do you think you are?

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.780
You have no right to speak with us.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.300
Scram.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.060
Go back and tell Tang Lianyue this.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.610
If he wishes to see us,

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.410
tell him to come to Blood River.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.740
I've put my Tracking Spider on him.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.060
I will find you

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.220
no matter where you are.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.500

[At the Autumn Equinox, day and night are equal, while you and I are apart]

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.810
Guardian Azure Dragon?

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.260
The Undertaker?

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.850
Muyu, oh, Muyu.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.460
I suppose everyone in the world

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.500
is hostile toward Blood River.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.810
Patriarch,

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.020
please don't be reckless.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.610
Am I being reckless just for trying to spar with

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.220
the successor of the Heart Sword?

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.890
I am Su Changhe, Patriarch of Blood River.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.740
Guardian Azure Dragon, it's an honor to meet you in Tianqi City.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.060
Please inform him

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.370
of my arrival.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.980
Inform him?

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.500
I wish to see

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.220
Prince of Langya.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.520
For the past few centuries,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.500
martial artists feared and respected

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.780
Blood River.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.130
You guys

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.170
are the blades of darkness.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.460
You show up unannounced to take one's life.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.740
I am Guardian Azure Dragon of Tianqi.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.060
My duty is to protect the city.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.540
Therefore,

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.220
I'm sorry.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.740
I unleashed the defensive sword energy

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.940
due to my duty.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.020
I don't care about that.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.500
However, Su Muyu

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.850
might care about that.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.980
My daughter encountered the Umbrella Ghost

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.500
in Tang Fort before.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.260
Now, he's the head of Su family.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.740
Fine.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.410
Master Su said

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.500
that they were involved in the uprising of Tang Clan.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.810
But it was obvious

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.220
that they sided with Tang Lianyue.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.700
They rescued Tang Lianyue.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.810
Due to that,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.090
we're indebted to him.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.300
Hanyi was able to find Tang Lianyue after that.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.780
But at the same time,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.410
Tang Linghuang was taken away

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.700
by a group of mysterious figures.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.940
They pursued them northward.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.130
However, there were still traces

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.700
of the Frostmoon Cocoon's toxin

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.650
within Lianyue's body.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.020
They were forced to stop halfway.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.740
After that,

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.540
they lost Tang Linghuang's trail.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.940
Tang Linghuang was taken

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.570
to Tianqi City.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.890
The scouts of Inner Security Division also said

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.840
that a group of mysterious figures

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.800
entered Tianqi City not long ago.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.130
But soon after,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.740
they managed to shake off their surveillance.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.220
Hanyi returned to Xueyue City as she didn't want

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.330
to be involved with Tianqi.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.610
Lianyue and I continued our investigation.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.890
We suspect

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.020
that the group of mysterious figures

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.220
were the ones who abducted Tang Linghuang.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.740
Right when we intended to investigate this case further,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.850
you guys entered Tianqi.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.020
We can help you guys

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.020
to locate them.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.890
So, you guys are here

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.700
to make a deal with us, am I right?

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.020
Speaking of which,

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.170
we need to settle some debts with them.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.630
You see, with my personality,

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.170
I would've gotten rid of them.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.540
But Su Muyu?

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.170
He said

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.220
this was an excellent opportunity.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.260
What opportunity?

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.700
An opportunity to become friends with Prince of Langya.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.740
Actually, I don't care about it at all.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.610
I'm an arrogant fellow who's full of myself.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.570
How could I become friends

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.940
with a shining hero

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:03.980
like Prince of Langya?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.170
But Su Muyu already said so.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.020
Why do you listen to him?

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:14.940
What did he say?

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.890
Su Muyu said

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.740
he wanted Blood River and Prince of Langya to become friends,

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.220
not me.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.610
Therefore,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.850
he told me to shut up.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.850
Isn't this ridiculous?

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.650
Who's the Patriarch here? He? Or I?

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.850
Why should I shut up?

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.410
I'm not going to shut up.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.090
I'm not willing to shut up.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.190
I don't care at all.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.740
I scoff at it.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.300
I sneer at it.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:39.370
I...

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.700
I yield.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.020
Therefore, Guardian Azure Dragon,

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.410
please inform

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.020
Prince of Langya

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.650
that I'm seeking an audience with him.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.260
What's your goal?

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.300
As for my goal,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.940
I wish to tell him face-to-face.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.810
Guardian Azure Dragon,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.570
you merely need to inform him.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.560
Where's Master Su,

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.650
whose power surpasses even yours?

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.650
Him?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.330
He needs to wake up early for a house-viewing session tomorrow.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.890
Therefore, he's already asleep.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.570
Come.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.300
Over here.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.090
I'll take you guys to the unit now.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.540
It's warm during winter and cool during summer.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.790
And, it's located in a lively area.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.980
It'll satisfy your wish to have guests over

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.020
and still keep your privacy.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.220
The previous two guests who lived here

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.810
all struck it rich.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.060
I believe

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.090
that you and your wife

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.170
will surely be able to achieve the same.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.920
Didn't I tell you already?

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.220
We aren't a couple.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.260
We're merely business partners.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.460
I understand.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.980
A gifted man and a graceful lady.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.090
A perfect couple like you two

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.060
came all the way to Tianqi to open an apothecary.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.330
And now, you say that you're merely business partners?

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.890
I'll never believe that.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.940
I'm sure you two

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.090
are members of noble families

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.170
who stole some money from the family

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.850
and eloped all the way here.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.300
I...

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.300
Don't worry.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.330
I won't tell anyone about it.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.570
My lips are sealed.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.090
That's not convincing at all.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.570
Come.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.460
Over here, please.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.260
Please.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.370
Here.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.810
What do you think about this unit?

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.060
This residence is pretty good.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.850
It's pretty quiet.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.500
I just don't know if business here will be good.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.650
As for that,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.570
that'll depend on you.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.260
What do you think about your medical skills?

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.020
I'm one of the top five physicians in the world.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.940
Where are the other four, then?

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.300
I don't think they're in Tianqi City.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.260
I suppose this place isn't secluded enough

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.170
to hide your popularity.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.650
He and his slick tongue.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.570
How much per month?

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.460
Per month?

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.980
We don't rent this place out in months.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.020
Only in years.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.060
You guys came all the way here to open an apothecary.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.570
How could you only rent it for one month?

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.170
What about half a year?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.170
I don't think we'll be staying here for long.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.060
Yeah.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.410
I don't really like the climate here.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.170
Nan'an City suits me better.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.060
And, the osmanthus cakes here aren't nice at all.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.300
Why don't

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.780
we

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.740
forget about it?

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.890
Half a year, huh?

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.540
Fine, then.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.500
Half a year of rent

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:29.700
will cost you 200 silver taels.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.170
It's that expensive?

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.570
This is Tianqi City, you know?

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.780
It's the busiest city in the world.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.570
200 silver taels,

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:41.980
it's a great bargain.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.600
You're calling this a great bargain?

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.430
You...

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.170
What?

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.610
It costs 200 silver taels

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.890
to rent this lousy place?

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.130
Go away.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.330
- Second Master Tu. - Mr. Su.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.460
Why did you find a lousy place as such?

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.410
Come with me.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.850
I have a huge unit

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.850
within Qile Pleasure House.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.220
It's ten times the size

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.980
of this unit.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.650
I have 80 servants there.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.220
You won't need to worry about a single thing living there.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.410
You can just live there.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.460
If you like the place,

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.330
you can have it.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.780
If you don't like the place,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.850
if you like somewhere that's quieter,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.780
I have a mountain villa

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.980
on the outskirts.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.330
It's 30 times the size of this unit.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.650
There's even a hunting ground inside.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.810
Come, I'll take you there.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.780
Second Master Tu, thank you so much.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.980
But it's fine.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.370
This place is pretty nice.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.460
We came here to open an apothecary.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.740
It'll be inconvenient for us

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.610
if the unit is too big.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.410
We should stay down-to-earth.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.630
It'll be troublesome

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.650
if the patients are too intimidated

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.090
by its sheer size to come inside.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:29.980
You have a point.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.330
This place will do, then.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.850
Which estate agency do you work for?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.940
Greetings, Second Master Tu.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.020
I'm an estate broker

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.260
for Home of Love.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.260
Never heard of it before.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.940
This is my friend.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:45.890
Give him a cheaper price.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.130
If so...

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.570
What about one...

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.540
How much?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.780
One silver tael.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:56.740
One silver tael?

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.260
That's right.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.130
My main intention

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.500
is to befriend Second Master Tu.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.980
You think you can befriend me

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.020
with such a meager amount?

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.700
That's not it, Second Master Tu.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.740
I suppose you got yourself a great bargain.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.260
Find some of your men

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.060
and help my friend

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.540
renovate the unit tomorrow.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.170
Mr. Su,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.510
when do you guys plan

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.330
to open the apothecary?

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.610
In three days.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.130
Did you hear him?

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.940
I did.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.890
Go and hire more help.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:20.890
Understood.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.850
I'll get to it immediately.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.410
Mr. Su.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.740
Why did you return to Tianqi City

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.780
all of a sudden?

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.170
I came here to get in someone's good graces.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.410
Who?

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.810
Prince of Langya.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.650
I suppose

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.700
he's a man among man, huh?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:48.740
Here.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:51.740
Mr. Su,

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.540
why is Blood River

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.980
looking for Prince of Langya?

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.130
Are you guys preparing for something huge?

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:58.980
What do you mean?

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.610
For example,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.890
staging a rebellion.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.130
Staging a rebellion?

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.650
May I join you guys?

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.060
No.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:08.810
What a shame.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.500
I mean,

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.780
we aren't here to stage a rebellion.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.170
Why are you guys looking for Prince of Langya, then?

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.850
Do you think a person like Prince of Langya

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.330
will stage a rebellion?

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.500
Not in the past, he won't.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.170
But now,

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.090
I think it's a little different.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.260
What's so different about it?

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.260
Lately, rumors have been circulating

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:32.460
in Tianqi City.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.700
Rumor has it

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.700
that his name was contained within

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.370
the Dragonseal Scroll he tore apart back then.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.710
Who in Tianqi City

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:41.810
is bold enough to spread such a rumor?

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.980
You're right.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.870
Back then, Prince of Langya invaded Tai'an Palace

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:45.850
with his army.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.800
He obtained the Dragonseal Scroll

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.300
from the late emperor.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.330
After that, he announced

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.170
that the late emperor had passed the throne to Xiao Ruojin,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.090
which is the current Emperor Mingde.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.300
But you need to know this.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.650
There were always

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.090
two Dragonseal Scrolls.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.940
One of them was ripped apart

00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.610
by Prince of Langya

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.460
outside Tai'an Palace back then.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:01.610
As for the other one,

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.300
it was supposed to be delivered to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.330
by the messenger eunuch.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.370
However, the bureau never received the scroll.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.540
And, the messenger eunuch

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.700
went missing as well.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.300
This rumor has existed since the beginning.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:13.850
Prince of Langya

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.330
didn't need to rip the scroll apart

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.410
if Xiao Ruojin's name was within it.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.370
It was merely because

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.540
he possessed immense military strength back then.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:21.980
If anyone refused to comply,

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.330
they wouldn't have survived the night.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:24.540
That's why no one

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:25.650
dared to mention it again

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.940
after the incident.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.650
Therefore,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.260
now that the rumors are starting to circulate again,

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.170
I'm sure someone is spreading them on purpose.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.570
Who do you think is the culprit, then?

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.780
I think it's Prince of Langya himself.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.460
Now, he has conquered all three areas of Nanjue,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.220
and has rendered numerous merits.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.220
He's already the top figure of Beili's military.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.940
His fame rivals that of

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.300
the founding emperor of Beili,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.570
Xiao Yi, also known as Emperor Tianwu.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.460
And, the army under him

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.700
is already raring to act.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.650
They want him to be the emperor.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.060
Perhaps back then, Prince of Langya

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.170
truly intended

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.130
to support his elder brother.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.220
But people change, you know?

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.460
Especially for those who stand at the peak for a long time.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.740
It gets lonely up there.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:02.940
After all,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.700
I'm sure everyone will strive for a higher position.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.060
Just like how Second Master Tu

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.060
intends to replace First Master Tu.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.820
Miss Bai, that's nonsense.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.340
That's definitely nonsense.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.820
It was just a joke.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.940
It seems my prediction is correct.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.290
Mr. Su, what was your prediction?

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.730
We encountered

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.650
some troublesome opponents

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.130
during our fight with Tang Clan in Sihuai City.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.170
Although

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.940
we aren't their targets,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.020
we found out

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.860
that

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.020
they were plotting something big.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.290
Combining the news you gave us just now,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.860
I suppose

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.060
they were trying to deal with Prince of Langya.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.610
Thank you, Second Master Tu.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.020
Mr. Su, if you require any help

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.770
while you're in Tianqi City,

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.860
just send your men

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.290
to Thousand-Gold Tower and ask for my help.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.540
Second Master Tu, do you intend to befriend Blood River?

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.340
Are you trying to get in our good graces?

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.060
Mr. Su, we hit it off immediately during our first encounter.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.900
We're true friends. I'm not trying to curry favors here.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.420
You know this too.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.290
I've been living in this pretentious city

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.060
called Tianqi for a long time.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.250
I especially treasure that feeling of

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.610
hitting it off at first sight.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.860
Moreover,

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.570
Mr. Su, you've saved me before.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.020
Where did you guys hit it off at first sight?

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.130
Of course it's on the Entertainment Street.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.730
The tavern was filled with drunken guests.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.900
Only Mr. Su and I

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.770
remained untempted.
