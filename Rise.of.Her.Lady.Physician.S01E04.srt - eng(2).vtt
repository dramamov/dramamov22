(Imperial Medical Bureau)

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.400
Miss Feng, I didn't expect

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.440
you'd also be willing to start

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.080
as a third-class medical attendant
just like us.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.960
Vice Minister Feng

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.360
is your uncle.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.640
You're from a big family

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.920
and have a bright future.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.200
From now on,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.840
we're all counting on you, Miss Feng.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.320
(Feng Yin,
Third-class Medical Attendant)

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720
We are all sisters

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.880
and colleagues.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.160
We should look after each other.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.080
I heard that this new batch of herbs

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
is worth a fortune.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.120
Look! Is that the Millennium Ganoderma?

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.240
This Ganoderma is so big

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.280
and bright.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.560
It must be quite old in years.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.920
What's wrong with you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.770
new attendants?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.320
This Cistanche has been damaged!

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.040
How could you be so careless?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.040
This is a five-year-old Cistanche herb.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.880
It's extremely precious

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.440
and worth 1000 taels of gold.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.920
Can you afford it?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.880
1000 taels of gold?

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.000
Miss Feng,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.620
(Su Ye, Third-class Medical Attendant)
I didn't mean to!

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.040
I don't have enough money!

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.360
(Sun Yu, Third-class Medical Attendant)
Do you think your apology is enough?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.120
Exactly.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.660
(Zhou Ning, Third-class Medical Attendant)
How much could

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.400
her apology be worth?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.320
Since she can't afford it,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.120
I'm afraid we have to punish her
according to the rules.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.920
Give her 20 strokes

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.440
and expel her from the palace.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.540
20 strokes!

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.840
Steward,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
I'm begging you.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.600
Please don't expel me!

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.840
I can't be expelled!

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.040
I'm begging you!

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.320
This is the rule!

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.320
No need to explain.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.680
My lord.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.120
May I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.920
check the herb

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.480
to see if there's a chance to remedy it?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.040
What can she possibly do?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.480
It's already damaged.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.440
It's Cistanche.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.400
Attendant Feng,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.640
in my opinion,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.840
it's just a three-year-old Cistanche.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.640
It only has limited effects
and is considered

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.840
an inexpensive herb.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.840
It's not worth a fortune.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.240
Why did she just say
it was five years old

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.520
and even want to expel her?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.800
This is so irresponsible.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840
Attendant,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.240
you say this Cistanche
is three years old.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.080
Do you have proof?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.240
Cistanche over five years old

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.800
has deep grooves like ravines

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.640
with an oily luster like amber.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.080
But this one

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.120
only has loose scales

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.240
and a faint smell.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640
It's just a poorly preserved
three-year-old inferior herb.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.560
Attendant Rong is right.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.240
(Wu Chunlin,
Minister of the Imperial Medical Bureau)

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.840
Greetings, Lord Wu.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.400
This Cistanche herb

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.840
is only about three years old.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.600
Due to improper storage,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.760
its color has deepened,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.880
and its scales have fallen off,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.240
so you mistakenly deemed
that it was five years old.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.260
Alright.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.680
Send this batch of new herbs
to the Imperial Pharmacy

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800
and take care of it.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.880
Hurry.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.960
Aye.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.280
Identifying herbs
is the foundation of medical skills.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.240
I hope all of you can observe carefully

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.560
and verify rigorously

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.840
like Attendant Rong does.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.520
Feng Yin.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.240
As a medical attendant,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.920
you even mistook the age of the herb.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.280
(Feng Mingyuan, Vice Minister)
This is the first time,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.440
so I won't punish you.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.560
I've realized my mistake.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.840
From now on, I'll be more careful.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.560
Starting today,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.670
you are officially the medical attendants
of the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.680
This is Minister Wu,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.440
who's in charge of
the entire Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.160
I'm the vice minister
of the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.480
From now on,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.760
I'll be responsible
for your performance reviews.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.560
Now that you've entered
the Imperial Medical Bureau,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.320
you work for the emperor
as medical practitioners.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.160
Men serve as medical officers,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.400
women as medical attendants,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.520
each with different duties.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.880
Third-class medical attendants
handle daily tasks such as

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.640
cleaning the medicine furnace
and medicinal dregs.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.080
Do not despise the small tasks.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.840
Expertise lies in these medicinal dregs.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.080
Second-class medical attendants
may work in the Imperial Pharmacy,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.920
dealing with various herbs day and night.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.640
They prepare herbs and make medicine

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.280
based on the prescriptions,
no mistakes allowed.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.960
As for first-class medical attendants,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.080
they follow imperial physicians
into the inner palace to treat patients.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.630
That is the highest honor
in the Imperial Medical Bureau

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.880
and the most dangerous duty.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.960
Hope you can all

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.560
act prudently.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.320
The deepest part here is the Case Room,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.920
preserving

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.040
the case records of
the royal family members over the years.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.080
It's top secret,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.880
and you must not trespass.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.640
(It means)

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.400
(the case records of my mom's)

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.980
(unjust accusation
of harming the Empress Dowager)

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.670
(must be kept in the Case Room.)

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.120
(If I find the case records,)

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.560
(I'll be able to figure out
what happened back then.)

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.200
Lord Feng,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.640
I wonder

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.280
how we can enter the Case Room

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.360
to study the cases.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.080
You're new here,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.080
yet you're already
asking about the Case Room.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.560
Overly ambitious.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.960
As the saying goes,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.680
high goals lead to intermediate success,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.680
whereas ordinary goals
only result in mediocrity.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.840
I only wish to set lofty aspirations

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.040
to constantly motivate myself
to strive forward.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.340
Only medical officers
and first-class medical attendants

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.800
are allowed to enter the Case Room.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.760
To become a first-class medical attendant,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.960
one must first become
a second-class medical attendant

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.320
and rank in the top three
in every assessment.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.720
After six full years,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.160
the person may become

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.520
a first-class attendant
with a physician's recommendation.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.840
Among the new medical attendants
every year,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.840
if one becomes
a first-class medical attendant,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.560
that would be a great fortune.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.000
Thanks for your guidance.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.920
I will certainly strive to become

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.760
a first-class medical attendant.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.600
Okay.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.760
I'll be waiting for that day.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.120
(The position of first-class attendant
belongs to me.)

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.880
(How dare a nobody like you
compete with me?)

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.190
Alright.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.320
That's all for today's matters.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.880
Tomorrow, we will arrange specific tasks.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.240
Thank you, Lord Feng.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.560
Lord Wu.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.410
I'm so nervous.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.800
Zelan.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.320
Thank you for helping me out.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.080
I didn't know you were so capable.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.520
Who taught you all the medical knowledge?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.000
Zelan, look.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.080
This herb is Armand Clematis Stem,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.240
cold in nature and extremely bitter.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.480
Have you ever tasted it?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.440
Kids need to be careful
with the things they eat.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.920
This is Bupleurum.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.560
Its root has

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.400
small thorns.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.640
You must be careful when holding it.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.360
Don't study medicine! It could kill you!

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.280
- No, it could kill you!
- Aunt!

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.890
Aunt, stop!

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.920
You can't study medicine!

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040
- It could kill you!
- Aunt!

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.080
You can't!

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.020
- I won't die.
- You'll lose your life...

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.760
- I'll protect you.
- It could kill you.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.320
You can't learn it.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.440
Aunt, I'll be fine.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.840
Our family has a private school

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.280
and many elders
with deep knowledge in medicine.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.810
Oh,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.800
I see.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.000
(If I don't check the records until)

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.440
(I become a first-class attendant,)

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.040
(it'll be way too late.)

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.520
(I must find a way to sneak into
the Case Room to see it.)

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.640
Zelan,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.040
is there something on your mind?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.720
Su Ye,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.240
do you know where the Case Room is?

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.920
I don't know either.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.360
The Case Room isn't for
third-class medical attendants

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.440
like us.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.600
I'm just curious.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.040
Let's go.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.520
Attendant Rong,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.200
I know where the Case Room is.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.720
Walk straight along this corridor,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.170
turn right at the end,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.080
and you will see a large red house.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.400
That's the Case Room.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.520
Thank you, Attendant Feng.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.520
You're welcome.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.160
Let's go.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.680
Attendant Feng,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
isn't the Case Room this way?

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.160
Is it?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.560
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.720
(Only first-class medical attendants
and medical officers)

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.720
(are allowed to enter.)

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.280
(I need to find a way
to disguise myself.)

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.480
My Lord.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.440
Are you going to the Laundry Room?

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.840
I happen to be going there.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.120
Why don't you let me deliver it for you?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.560
This...

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.640
Alright then. Thank you.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.920
Go straight, turn right at the end,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.520
and there's a large red house.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.880
This should be the place.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.840
(Why is)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.640
(the Case Room so damp?)

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.440
(Why is it the Men's Bathhouse?)

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.000
Since you're here,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.200
help me scrub my back.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.880
Let's go.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.800
Who are you?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.840
I...

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.640
I'm a new medical officer here,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.840
and I accidentally
came to the wrong place.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.040
New medical officer?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.240
You have smooth skin,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.120
a bird-like voice,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.480
and no Adam's apple.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.280
When did we

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.440
recruit a female officer?
