[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.690
[Episode 22]

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.530
You think
that tiny bit of demon power of yours

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.070
can let the Grief Tree seed
take root and sprout?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.840
I'd love to see

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.590
how you make that happen.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.430
Who are you?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.910
Why do you

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.360
look identical to me?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.190
Identical to you?

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.350
Let me put it this way.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.079
It is your cowardly shell

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120
has been suppressing my presence.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.990
Instead of saying we have identical looks,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.350
it's more accurate to say...

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.000
I am...

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.120
who you really are.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.520
Now that you're craving power,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.030
I might as well do you a favor

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.220
and help you let this tree seed

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.560
take root and sprout.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.840
Your power originates from love.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.150
Little Spider,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.150
close your eyes.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.590
Drop your facade.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:31.910
Let it

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.910
feel your true desires.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.030
Little Spider,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.590
it was your affection

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.430
for Wangquan Fugui that brought you here.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.840
Because of your feelings for him,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.280
you chose to take this test.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.840
Everything you've done

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.240
stems from love,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.870
right?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.680
But if love could truly give you power,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.030
why are you still so weak to this day?

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.560
Why haven't

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.190
your efforts paid off by now?

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.390
Oh, right.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.630
Ponder over this:

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.430
why would your dear Young Master Fugui

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.560
ditch you right away

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.870
every time an emergency came up?

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800
It happened in the Peach Village,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.510
and again in the small woods

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.840
inside Wangquan Manor.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.040
That proves your love

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.430
is just like a rootless tree.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.480
How can it give you power?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.800
Think about it, Little Spider.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.510
You already gave your all.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.750
But what have you got in return?

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.430
In the end...

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.070
In the end...

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.010
I didn't even get to see
Young Master Fugui

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.720
for one last time.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920
Little Spider,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.390
you're finally realized the truth.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.870
You were only a toy

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.930
he killed time with when he got bored.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.390
Listen,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.040
all relationships
are about using each other.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.950
Stop being stubborn, Little Spider.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.240
In this world,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.600
only hatred lives forever.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.630
If you still insist

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.630
on practicing the Way with love,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.330
then...

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.750
you deserve to remain this weak!

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.870
Why not accept me

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.630
and the hatred in your heart?

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.360
Only in this way

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.870
will you gain the power
to change everything.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.390
No.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920
You're wrong.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.300
It's not like that.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.390
It's never been wrong

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.430
to love someone.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.610
As long as there's love in one's heart,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.480
one will have the power to live!

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.800
Fine.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.480
Then I don't mind

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.510
sending you to hell.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.830
Wake up, Little Spider.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.560
Practicing the Way with love

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.680
is a hopeless attempt.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.480
The only consistent thing
in this world is hatred!

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.000
Look, Little Spider.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.800
This place

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.270
is full of fools just like you.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.240
Today,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.870
you will end up the same as them.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.390
How did this happen?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.920
Why did you do this?

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.480
Because they all should die!

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.830
Because they were all in an vain attempt

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.750
to practice the Way with love
just like you.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.800
This would only turn you

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.130
into weak, pathetic and cowardly beings.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.480
You all yearned for power,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.810
but refused to face
the truth of the world.

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.120
There is no such thing

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.980
as pure and genuine Power of Love.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.120
Is that the reason

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.600
that we should die

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.640
and deserve no chance of living?

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.480
Of course.

Why rise with the wind even

Why, as dust, do you refuse to fall

not to bind you,

but in the hope
that you would see this world for me.

Even when you find yourself in darkness,

humble and small,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.440

Do you see that ray of light?

Dust dances with light.

do we refuse to fall to the ground?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.630
Have you still not found access
to the Joy and Sorrow Sect?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.200
It's been six hours.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.440
I'm afraid Miss Qingtong...

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.360
is dead by now.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.030
How dare you curse her.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.670
No, no, no.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.230
Don't hurt me.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.270
Such strong demonic energy.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.150
Qingtong?

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.120
Qingtong.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.720
Have you tamed that tree seed?

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.080
The Joy and Sorrow Sect
has been destroyed.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.910
From now on,

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.990
nobody will be trapped there anymore.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.180
Why is your demonic energy

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.030
a complete mess now?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.580
Perhaps you're sensing it wrong,

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.270
since you haven't
fully merged with the tree seed

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.600
that you tamed just now.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.780
You already promised me not to
work on such evil magic anymore.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.550
Then, from today on,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.600
this Asura Hall

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.750
is not to be used again.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.550
Intruders...

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.510
must die.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.140
From today onward,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.240
you're our new governor.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.800
Please be our leader!

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.150
Greetings, Governor!

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.440
Good.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.670
Fugui said this lad

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.790
could become one
with the Water-Control Orb.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.840
Let me see

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.120
what's so special about him.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.200
You can't control sand.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.720
There's a Water-Control Orb in you.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.220
How about this?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.760
Try controlling water instead.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.160
Master disallows me
to control water at will.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.390
Do you have to be so obedient?

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.320
Besides,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.520
you're out of the Royal Master's sight.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.570
Give it a try.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.670
It...

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.670
It...

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.960
It's not a good idea, is it?

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.360
What's not good about it?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.000
Center your demonic energy
in the lower abdomen.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.510
Then channel it upward with the power

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.360
of the Water-Control Orb,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.670
like water flowing into a river.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.270
You got it?

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:42.750
Got it.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.360
Proceed.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.440
Now that I see it,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.570
maybe this lad
can really refine the Water-Control orb.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.030
Celestial Master, look!

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.870
Not bad.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.080
I think you should heed the Royal Master's

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.290
advice as much as possible.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.750
Yes.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.670
Is Master cooking now?

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.640
Meatballs!

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.160
This dog demon does have

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.490
an acute sense of smell.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.329
Here you are, Fugui.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.960
Wait, you've picked all the meat.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.359
What's left for us to eat?

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.330
I'll start with meat, and then vegetable.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.570
Celestial Master,

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.070
any comment on my performance today?

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.880
It was just...

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.030
You're a real genius.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.510
Smart and sharp.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.550
Really?

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.830
Is it true?

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.960
I think that too.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.010
Celestial Master, listen.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.830
When I left the palace years ago,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.890
I did meet the girl
that you said I was meant to be with.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.040
The girl you're meant to be with?

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.730
Keep going.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.720
I met her as I was walking

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.020
the desert after leaving the palace.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.400
Seriously?

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.960
You had the demon power

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.290
to control sandstorms,

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.280
before receiving any training

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.640
or taking a human form?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:16.960
Yes.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
He never lies.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.590
Were you stimulated

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.050
by something at that time?

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.030
I remember I was being held in her arms.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.680
She nearly passed out,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.740
yet she was still thinking of others.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.750
Guys, leave now.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.440
Run, guys.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.240
I was thinking
Let’s go.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.110
She's so pretty and nice.
Let’s go.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.310
bury such a nice and pretty lady.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.350
Then...

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.720
Then I released enormous demon power.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.750
Does it mean...

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.030
you like her?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.270
Yes.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.020
Why not pursue her?

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.880
Perhaps she's the key

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.070
to unleashing your demon power.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.060
I did go see her,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.830
but was then beaten and driven away.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.070
As Master said,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.400
humans and demons

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.110
can't be happy
without the balanced development

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.030
of skills and spirits.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.550
So,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.400
I must quickly strengthen my demon power.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.350
No, no, no.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:13.850
Wait a minute.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.880
You're taking his romantic advice

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.810
to court a woman?

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.400
Yes.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.880
Impressive.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.680
It's true that my love life

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.010
is quite bumpy,

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.640
but let me share my perspective
as a seasoned player in the game—

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.350
who can rival a reluctant love interest?

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.920
A persistant suitor!

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.880
Speaking from my experience,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.910
forget about anything.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.510
You should

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.240
just propose marriage to her!

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.640
Really?

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.240
Let's set a goal.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.000
Make 100 attempts
for the love of your life,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.590
will you?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.640
I'll try the 101st time if I have to!

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.400
Good.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.270
It's settled then.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.090
Tomorrow morning,

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.920
I'll devise

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.120
a battle plan for you.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.440
Don't wait till then.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.880
Tell me your plan now.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.690
Just say it.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.850
Maybe a few tips first.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:58.640
Fine.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.410
Now, I'll teach you

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.210
the art of relentless pursuit.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.150
That poor dog pestered me
all night yesterday.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480
I'm so sleepy.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.660
We didn't disturb you, did we?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.920
What do you think?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.260
I wished I could've covered your mouths.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.400
Fugui,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.200
you do care about me.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.810
Celestial Master!

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.720
It's already morning.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.120
Let's go visit Xueyang.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.900
Are you not coming with us?

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.680
The capable shoulder more responsibility.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.210
You stirred this up.
I'd rather stay out of it.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.200
Fine.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.790
Let me show you

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.240
what I've got.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.400
Follow me!

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.260
Celestial Master,

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.670
any more words of advice?

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.920
What advice do you need
for sending presents?

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.440
You see,
a generous gift giver is never rejected.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.270
When you give her all your favorites,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.470
you two will get on...

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.000
like a house on fire.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.400
Got it!

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.480
I'll take off.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.720
Remember:

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.550
you'll make it work!

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.060
I'll come back with good news!

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.140
[4 hours later]

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.680
Celestial Master...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.070
I'm back.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.030
So soon?

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.030
Celestial Master!

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.440
I was right, huh?

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.920
If you followed my instructions,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.720
you'd surely hit it off with her.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.350
She froze me again

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.960
and kicked me out.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.610
That shouldn't have happened.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.020
Why would she freeze a gift giver?

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.510
Gold, silver, jewelry,

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.400
antiques and jade.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.730
Don't girls all like...

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.110
B-Black strips,

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.790
dried hamsters, scratching pads, bones,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.160
and ten bundles of red willow branches
for playing fetch?

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.690
What are these?

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.350
My favorite things.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.880
Wait, you...

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.070
Look, Celestial Master,

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.110
you told me

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.000
to send her my favorite things.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.160
I said it right.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.380
Drop that subject for now.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.890
You've taken a human form.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.090
Hide your habits as an animal, alright?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.930
First of all,

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.800
you need to act like a human.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.030
A human. Understood?

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.410
Enlighten me, Celestial Master.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.640
Since you're inquiring cordially,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.270
I might as well kindly
share my wisdom with you.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.790
I'm been through the trials in love,

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.350
so listen to me carefully.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:14.960
Sure.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.680
You must tailor your approach

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.750
to different people.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.590
For example, to win my heart over,

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.640
it's better to send me money

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.240
than a usual pleasantry.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720
That even rhymes.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.350

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.790
Will that really work?

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.880
How could you just miss the key point?

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.480
I was telling you

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.510
to go for a snake's weakest spot
so as to defeat it.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.400
Do you understand?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.720
But I'm not bothered by snakes now.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.750
It was a metaphor.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.640
I mean metaphor. Do you understand?
Don’t be angry. Don’t be angry.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.440
I know what a metaphor is.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.240
That metaphor

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.650
meant...

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.200

You think we're hunting demons here?

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.030
Celestial Master, you once told me

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.230
that love is a battle.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.960
A single wrong step could lead to

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.250
a complete failure.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.200
Indeed, love is a battle.

Make a wrong step, and the game is lost.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:10.070

know well about yourself and your target.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.400

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.220
They're quite pretty.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.370
What's wrong with you?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.020
If there's nothing else, go home.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:55.510
Okay.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.110
You...

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.200
What is it now?

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.640
You haven't beaten me today.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.590
I'll come again tomorrow!

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:28.270
Great! Bravo!

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.830
Come again tomorrow!

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:30.560
See you soon!

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.240
This silly dog

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.140
is actually adorable.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.850
Why is it so hard to control my anger

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.960
when I refine this tree seed?

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.680
Besides, the aura
released by the demon power

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.830
is very similar to that of the Black Fox.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.890
What's the connection between them?

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.560
Qingtong,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.000
I've brought the list

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.070
of dark magic artifacts and techniques

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.000
from Asura Hall.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.820
Soul-Devouring Umbrella...

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.490
I heard about it from Madam Yin

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.240
back in the Silk Cave.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.850
It can not only disturb others' minds,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.920
but also transfer others' life force

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.830
to the user.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.750
It's that old wretch's finest work.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.480
Qingtong,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.760
sinister though these magic tools are,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.090
they're really useful.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.219
Why don't we...

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.070
From this moment on, these items

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.870
and Asure Hall

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.210
will be sealed forever.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.270
Any use of them is forbidden.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:26.840
Got it.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.580
Qingcheng,

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.159
have you forgotten the vow we made?

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.060
We promised

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.000
to build

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.110
a better home together.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.110
Yes.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.000
Governor,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.880
the man you asked for is here.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.800
You're Jiang Bo?

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.130
I heard you were put in jail

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.840
for secretly releasing

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.600
many humans and demons from Asura Hall.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.440
[Jiang Bo, a guard of Qianji City]

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.510
Cut the crap.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.880
Take my life as you please.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.030
Jiang Bo,

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.760
you'd better behave

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.840
and listen to my sister.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.290
You're as gutsy as I expected.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.550
Will you

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.320
stay here in your post

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.760
as the chief guard

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.150
at my service?

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.280
I promise

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.160
I will transform this place

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.570
into something completely different

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.280
from the Qianji City
everyone used to know.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.880
This is incredible.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.440
After making over 90 marriage proposals,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.570
you're still alive.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.440
Plus, you've been beaten
less and less often recently.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.710
This means General Li has started

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.510
treating you better and better.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.560
That's not it.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.590
The truth is Xueyang has got injured.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.440
No way!

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.880
Did you lay a hand on her?

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.710
Being heartless

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.030
can't get you a wife!

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.360
You should learn from me.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.880
When the girl you love
slaps your left cheek,

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.230
you should present
your right cheek to her right away.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.690
Isn't that a bit pathetic?

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.960
Stop taking that attitude,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.440
or I can't teach you anymore.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.150
Celestial Master, don't be mad.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.550
Let me tell you the story.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.150
Xueyang has been fighting demons a lot
lately.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.610
She was injured by a demon.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.120
Celestial Master,

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.070
I've heard there's a Soldier
in Yiqi Alliance.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.670
He's a great fighter, right?

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.520
Why did you suddenly bring that up?

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.630
Because I hope to be as strong as he is.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.490
That way, I can protect who I love.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.110
I've decided tomorrow's gift for Xueyang.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.000
Isn't it

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.840
the water demon
that injured General Li?

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.320
Look!

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.590
I can't believe he has captured it!

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.190
Indeed.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.400
He's really something.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:55.960
Yeah.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.710
Hei, Bai.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:57.840
Boss.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.110
Boss.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:58.640
General.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.330
Stay still!

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.400
Did you subdue this demon yourself?

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.000
Yes.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.710
This water demon
is the nemesis of corsac foxes.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.230
But I don't care about that.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.510
I must teach him a lesson

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.510
for injuring you.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.540
That's why I caught him

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.320
and brought him to you as a gift.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.590
A gift for me?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.060
This way, you won't have to go out
to fight demons today.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.920
How romantic.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.860
You've indeed saved me much trouble.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.380
Thanks.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:43.930
Are you better now after being injured?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.480
I'm better now.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:05.230
However,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.610
the whole thing ends here.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.670
I won't accept you,

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.110
since humans and demons
are fundamentally different.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.370
Do not come here again.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:18.800
Got it.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.940
I'll come again tomorrow.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.590
That...

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:23.280
What did he say?

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:23.840
See you tomorrow!

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.030
He said he'd come again tomorrow.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.030
Come again tomorrow?

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.840
See you tomorrow!

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.280
See you!

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.920
See you tomorrow, guys!

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.030
Do you think he'll come again tomorrow?

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.030
He definitely will.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.670
I think so.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.440
He'll most probably come again.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:31.920
Yeah.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.410
Was I not being clear enough?

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.680
You did make it clear.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.510
But...

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.890
why did he take it as...

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.360
Then maybe
you were not being clear enough.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:42.110
You...

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.110
Dismissed, guys!

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.760
Back to your places!

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.710
Come on.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:48.970
Let's go!

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.070
Get in a line!

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.240
Dress to the front!

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.590
This many demons today?

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.150
Align!

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.480
He really did come here.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.630
You were so right.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.230
Hei, Bai!

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:03.320
Boss.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.110
Xueyang,

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.030
I caught 7 demons for you this time.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:07.030
Impressive, huh?

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.770
I'm warning you,

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.550
I don't need others to fight

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.800
my own battles.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.070
Are you trying to snatch my job

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.600
by bringing demons here every day?

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.760
I-I only want to protect you

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.150
and lighten your burden.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.360
I-I don't mean to snatch your job.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.070
I...

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.720
I've irritated you, have I?

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.920
Seeing how upset he is,

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.280
why am I suddenly feeling sorry?

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.440
I'm not mad at you

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.200
for catching demons for me.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.070
It's just that I hate to

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.320
owe anyone a favor.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.510
You must've been through much trouble.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.440
Have some water.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.670
Thank you for your gift.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.130
I'll come again tomorrow!

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.670
See you tomorrow!

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.320
I...

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.980
You made yourself very clear.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:18.670
He...

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.440
And he interpreted it correctly.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.070
Then...

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.320
Then you'll be a couple sooner or later.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:24.880
You...

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.840
Enough. Dismissed!

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.190
All you do is eat and sleep!

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.150
Scatter, now!

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.480
Just go!

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.800
Don't you have better things to do?

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.710
Get a move on!

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.150
Move!

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.550
This...

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.840
A huge humiliation, isn't it?

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.150
Fugui,

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.030
what do you think?

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.710
There will be good news soon.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.610
Is Li Xueyang only into handsome guys?

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.710
Look at him.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.840
Except for his good looks,

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.340
he has no other advantage.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.880
No redeeming qualities whatsoever.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.590
He's loyal, reliable,

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.820
honest, and not greedy for money.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.200
Isn't he better than you?

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.510
You're not trying to sugarcoat
the criticism at all, are you?

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.510
Fugui, you're not as nice as before.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.280
This is wrong.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:30.880
Fugui,

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:32.880
what are you busy doing?

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.170
Counting the days after we reunited, huh?

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.250
How thoughtful.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.030
I wonder

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.110
when you will ever grow up

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.550
and be more serious.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.710
This is sea buckthorn juice,

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.310
specially prepared for you.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.760
In the past few days,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.760
I finished reading the historical records
of the Corsac Fox State in the palace.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.690
Back in Wangquan Manor, I also read

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.360
the secret history of the dragon clan
from the Western Regions.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.030
I compared those two books,

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.110
and found 17 discrepancies.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.150
Do you get it?

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:14.320
Not really.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.410
What do you think

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.280
of the nobles and ministers

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.000
of the Corsac Fox State?

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.030
Fugui,

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.280
as I told you before,

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.440
they were silly.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.920
All of them were fools.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.980
You smarty-pants.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.080
Several hundred years ago,

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.840
the dragon clan and human race
fought a great war,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.400
leaving all races devastated.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.730
Only the Corsac Fox Clan

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.550
managed to become rulers
of the Western Regions.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:39.190
Hmm.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.710
You know what,

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.290
even fools can be lucky sometimes.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.490
For hundreds of years,

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.320
every generation of them has prospered.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.720
You think it's just luck?

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.510
I entered the Imperial Preceptor's
intelligence archives

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.970
with the Invisibility Talisman
you gave me.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.230
At first, I only planned

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.430
to investigate the Water-Control Orb.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:59.610
But unexpectedly,

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.320
deep in the archives,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.450
I discovered something astonishing.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.590
I found that the Corsac Fox State

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.030
has detailed files
on all the major generals

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.280
of the Li Army,

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.110
including their dietary habits,

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.710
daily routines and hobbies.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.160
In particular, the scroll

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.750
[Li Chongzhen]

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:14.880
[Li Xueyang]

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.480
recording Li Xueyang's information

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.540
has been marked with a special color.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.030
It even includes

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.560
what she has done every day.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.010
The Corsac Fox State must have

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:23.320
[Li Xueyang]

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.400
a secret purpose for doing so.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.150
Doesn't it mean

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.590
everyone in the Li Army

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.150
is in danger now,

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.090
especially Li Xueyang?

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.240
That poor dog and Li Xueyang
are falling in love...

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.920
Have you noticed

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.490
that the Corsac Fox King
seems to be the happiest among all?

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.330
I've always felt

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.280
there's something off.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.360
That poor dog...

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.110
genuinely loves Li Xueyang,

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.280
right?

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:52.360
Right.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.270
To the point of foolishness.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.550
That covers all the other things.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.240
Let nature take its course.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.150
Well,

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:04.470
you came at the right time.
I need your help.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:06.800
Okay.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.840
Don't follow me.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.030
I take no interest

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.690
in staying up all night
with your snores around.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.450
When I finish refining this tree seed,

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.510
I'll set out

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:30.240
to look for Young Master Fugui.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:32.880
I need to hurry.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.150
Madam,

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.880
Wangquan Fugui
would rather destroy himself

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.280
than submit to you.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.550
Why not send someone to kill him?

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.550
The Third Young Master of Aolai's prophecy
can't be wrong.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:01.630
Only those 13 moves

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.240
of the Heaven-and-earth strike
can help me out of the circle.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.880
So, Wangquan Fugui cannot die yet.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.520
But the Soldier would rather kill himself

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.150
than obey you, Madam.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.800
Of course I know that.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.030
That's why

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.670
I have prepared

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.000
a little black fox for him in the circle.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.960
It will appear when the right time comes

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.370
and take win his heart.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.440
How brilliant of you, Madam.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.150
Who's there?

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.740
Why am I able to see these visions?

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.030
They said
Young Master Fugui is still alive.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.480
Is it true or not?

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.880
I'd better

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.960
pay a visit to Tushan soon.
