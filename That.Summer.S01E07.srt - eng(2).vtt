00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:19.685
I'm entering a boxing match.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:20.916
What do you need the money for?

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.879
I'm going to win back my dad's motorcycle.

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:25.177
I think people already know about us.

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:28.184
They were talking about it at the market and at the district office.

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:30.323
Running from problems has no end.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.853
Let's face them together.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:35.854
I don't know why, but you look kind of familiar.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.215
You don't remember being….

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:39.311
Being what?

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:42.350
You're saying Wave is a prince?

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:43.235
Yes.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:46.671
It's also my first time feeling love for someone.

00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:48.291
I love you too.

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:53.788
Sleepy? Then go get some sleep.

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.096
I woke up super early for this,

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.306
so I have to watch it.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:05.516
I'll wait and see.

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:07.312
Thanks, though.

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:09.782
I've wanted to see the sunrise.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:14.843
It feels like a new beginning.

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.502
But I like sunsets more.

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:22.755
Sunsets are pretty too,

00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:26.444
but they can feel sad sometimes.

00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:31.728
But once the sun rises, everything lights up

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:34.536
it feels like there's hope.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.046
No matter how bad things get,

00:01:37.623 --> 00:01:38.933
you can always start again.

00:01:41.512 --> 00:01:42.533
What if…

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:47.130
What if your family were millionaires?

00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:50.829
What if you had a really warm home,

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:54.202
and someone who truly loved you
was waiting for you?

00:01:56.514 --> 00:01:57.726
What if you were—

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.842
If that's the case, that sounds nice too.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.642
If I really were a millionaire,

00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:14.207
I'd build schools and charities
for poor kids who love music.

00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:19.085
But I'm happy with my life now.

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:23.945
Sitting here watching the sunrise
with someone I love—

00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:28.882
no money could buy this happiness.

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:31.709
Got it.

Hey, the sun's rising.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.929
Lava, look. It's so beautiful.

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:55.241
Mm. Good morning.

00:06:14.693 --> 00:06:16.112
Don't tell Wave.

00:06:17.557 --> 00:06:19.824
I mean Prince Davin.

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:28.086
But Wave, or Prince Davin, has the right to learn the truth
and know who he really is.

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:29.742
And what do we get from telling him?

00:06:30.565 --> 00:06:32.538
Don't forget he is in danger.

00:06:32.538 --> 00:06:34.652
Our job is to keep him safe

00:06:35.653 --> 00:06:37.450
until they send someone to get him.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.416
Don't you dare tell anyone.

00:06:42.216 --> 00:06:45.677
This stays between you and me.

00:06:58.047 --> 00:06:58.988
Looking for this?

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:01.387
Yeah.

00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:03.045
You read my mind, huh?

00:07:13.763 --> 00:07:16.625
I want to do something nice for you too.

00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:17.407
Thanks.

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:26.475
Mm, it's refreshing!

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:48.307
I think your muscles got bigger.

00:07:51.798 --> 00:07:54.204
Yeah, I've been boxing,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.638
and also weight training these days.

00:07:56.638 --> 00:08:00.079
Still, I don't like you boxing.

00:08:01.257 --> 00:08:04.464
I know you want your dad proud,

00:08:05.687 --> 00:08:10.909
but he wouldn't want you hurt, right?

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.590
Don't worry. I'm stronger now.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.058
I even beat Tum today.

00:08:16.858 --> 00:08:19.820
But others might hit harder than Tum.

00:08:26.712 --> 00:08:27.397
Here.

00:08:27.997 --> 00:08:29.071
Sell it.

00:08:29.605 --> 00:08:31.350
We can split the money.

00:08:32.328 --> 00:08:35.317
You said this watch is expensive, right?

00:08:36.109 --> 00:08:37.603
Use it to buy back your dad's motorbike.

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:41.677
Keep the rest for me.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:46.730
I don't even know how long I'll be stuck here.

00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:51.552
You see, no one has come looking for me.

00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:58.542
Maybe my family or my loved ones

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:02.018
are gone for real.

00:09:05.931 --> 00:09:09.763
Maybe it's time I start over.

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:13.827
I can't accept it.

00:09:16.028 --> 00:09:17.450
I want to stand on my own.

00:09:18.895 --> 00:09:24.884
That's exactly why I like you.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.126
Everything has been settled.

00:09:46.793 --> 00:09:48.691
No one will trace it back to you, General.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.724
Great. I can finally take care of the rest.

00:09:58.636 --> 00:10:00.066
It's been left too long.

00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:01.850
You really met Davin?

00:10:03.095 --> 00:10:06.023
Yes. He didn't recognize me.

00:10:06.357 --> 00:10:08.793
It's probably because you hurt him,
Mr. Victor.

00:10:08.793 --> 00:10:10.335
But I've handled both of them,

00:10:10.646 --> 00:10:12.885
the prince and his rescuer.

00:10:14.441 --> 00:10:16.843
If that's all,
I'll take my leave now, General.

00:10:25.962 --> 00:10:27.271
Do you really trust him?

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.670
More than you, maybe?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.767
I made a mistake,

00:10:31.767 --> 00:10:33.574
but I should be the one to end this.

00:10:33.574 --> 00:10:35.527
You still have plenty to do.

00:10:35.794 --> 00:10:37.288
I've planned your future already.

00:10:37.421 --> 00:10:39.001
Don't let me down again.

00:10:53.993 --> 00:10:55.854
You're still acting normal?

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:59.137
Of course. I'm acting totally normal.

00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:00.590
What kind of normal?

00:11:00.857 --> 00:11:03.065
Normal as in dating him—

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:04.233
I mean, dating the prince.

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:05.776
I feel so uncomfortable.

00:11:05.887 --> 00:11:07.944
We're doing this to help,

00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.587
not just him, but his country too.

00:11:11.787 --> 00:11:12.637
Oh, please.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.788
If he returns home,

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.528
you'll be the president there.

00:11:20.085 --> 00:11:23.027
Be honest. You really love him, right?

00:11:23.027 --> 00:11:23.919
Yeah, I do.

00:11:27.943 --> 00:11:28.753
So what now?

00:11:32.377 --> 00:11:35.471
I told you you're asking for trouble.

00:11:37.872 --> 00:11:39.048
Then what should I do?

00:11:39.293 --> 00:11:40.233
Should I just break up with him?

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:41.089
Don't you dare.

00:11:41.644 --> 00:11:42.985
What reason will you even use?

00:11:43.585 --> 00:11:45.352
Just keep playing the island boyfriend.

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:46.829
We'll see what happens next.

00:11:48.252 --> 00:11:49.804
Right now, his safety comes first.

00:11:55.985 --> 00:11:58.245
FAGGOT

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.688
Shit! Who did this?!

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.424
Who do you think did this?

00:12:19.646 --> 00:12:20.819
Probably a rival.

00:12:21.353 --> 00:12:22.618
They probably saw
Uncle Peng getting popular.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.313
Why are they playing dirty?

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:28.925
Why drag his private life into this?

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.108
How does having a boyfriend
make him lose?

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.272
People on the island seem to like him.

00:12:37.117 --> 00:12:39.287
They're okay with him as the resort owner,

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.261
but they won't want him to take a big role,

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.013
like being the village head
in charge of the island.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.445
Does loving a man
make someone less capable of their job?

00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:52.734
Now I get why Uncle Peng
lives the way he does.

00:13:07.854 --> 00:13:11.005
Dad, don't go in. I'll handle it.

00:13:11.005 --> 00:13:13.351
No. This is humiliation!

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.253
Come out and talk now, Peng!

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:20.400
Hellon, Director.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.483
Is something wrong?

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.487
No need to pretend to be nice.

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:25.766
You've been seeing my son for a year
behind my back!

00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:27.462
You totally humiliated me!

00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:28.966
Dad, let's go back.

00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:29.981
We'd better talk at home.

00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:32.794
No. We'll talk here and now!

00:13:32.927 --> 00:13:34.575
Otherwise, we won't see each other again! .

00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:43.802
I'm sorry.

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:45.691
I just thought—

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:46.693
Thought what?

00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:51.749
That I couldn't handle my son dating a man?

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:56.755
Don't think that just because I'm old,
I won't be open to anything.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.118
However my son is,

00:14:01.697 --> 00:14:04.195
whoever he loves, I'll love them too.

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:07.791
But I'm someone with status in society.

00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:11.121
Do you know
what people are gossiping about?

00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:17.281
The director's son, the young doctor,
got played and slept with by a guy from Bangkok!

00:14:19.089 --> 00:14:20.839
That's too much, Dad.

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:22.223
No one's saying that.

00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:23.768
I really heard it.

00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:26.112
But I didn't mean it like that.

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:30.109
Dr. Wut and I truly love each other.

00:14:30.109 --> 00:14:31.112
You just talk big!

00:14:31.868 --> 00:14:35.400
If you really love my son,
you need to do more for him!

00:14:42.826 --> 00:14:45.115
Do you want to marry my son?

00:14:49.384 --> 00:14:50.065
Yes, I do.

00:14:52.087 --> 00:14:53.527
Then here's my offer.

00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:59.711
If you win this village head election,

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.149
I'll let you marry him.

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:09.875
And if I lose?

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:11.354
If you lose,

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:17.759
you and Wut must break up.

00:15:39.915 --> 00:15:40.529
Ouch!

00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:43.468
Are you okay?

00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:45.082
It's swelling.

00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:52.699
It's fine. Just a bit of incense ash.

00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:54.817
But it's all red.

00:16:15.984 --> 00:16:19.361
Even in the temple, huh?

00:16:24.094 --> 00:16:24.594
Eh?

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.662
Where is Lava, by the way?

00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.008
He probably died pooping.
He's been gone forever.

00:16:36.905 --> 00:16:37.680
Put some ice on it.

00:16:37.818 --> 00:16:38.584
It'll be fine soon.

00:16:41.183 --> 00:16:42.685
Where did you get the ice?

00:16:43.993 --> 00:16:44.852
Outside the temple.

00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:49.955
Wow, that's so romantic.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:52.342
Can I get a piece of this moment?

00:16:57.007 --> 00:16:59.602
- Damn, that's sweet.
- Whoa.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:00.863
They're super caring for each other.

00:17:01.242 --> 00:17:03.614
But don't get too lovey-dovey.
You guys still need to help Peng.

00:17:03.614 --> 00:17:04.332
Yeah.

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.433
I guess we'll campaign every way we can.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.550
How about this?

00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:11.097
I'll handle straight guys,

00:17:11.235 --> 00:17:16.101
songtaew drivers, motorbike taxi guys,
and construction workers.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.460
And I'll focus on women.

00:17:19.615 --> 00:17:22.079
I'll get all the nurses to vote for him.

00:17:22.217 --> 00:17:25.212
I'll sell the charm of the chief and Dr. Wut
as a ship-style couple,

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.191
fighting for their love
against a harsh father-in-law!

00:17:28.398 --> 00:17:30.861
Wow, perfect target group.

00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:31.535
Great job.

00:17:33.876 --> 00:17:35.735
What about me? Who is my target?

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.865
You only have one target. It's Lava.

00:17:39.054 --> 00:17:42.139
Whatever you say or do
hits the target anyway.

00:17:50.596 --> 00:17:51.796
Are you guys fighting fish or what?

00:17:54.577 --> 00:17:55.524
Let's do this.

00:17:58.708 --> 00:17:59.944
Vote number 5, please!

00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:02.349
We'll protect the environment,
promote tourism,

00:18:02.502 --> 00:18:03.865
and say no to corruption.

00:18:04.743 --> 00:18:05.837
Please vote number 5.

00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:08.381
Vote number 5, Chief Peng Pongsakorn.

00:18:08.897 --> 00:18:12.940
Give the new generation a chance
to make our island better—

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.606
economy, nature and happy families!

00:18:17.743 --> 00:18:18.944
Where there's water, there's fish.

00:18:18.944 --> 00:18:20.290
Where there's a bar, there's booze.

00:18:20.479 --> 00:18:20.981
Tum!

00:18:21.446 --> 00:18:22.796
Where there's a field, there's rice!

00:18:23.346 --> 00:18:25.301
Kratae, have you ever seen
a rice field on this island?

00:18:26.014 --> 00:18:26.629
Well, you're right.

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:28.679
Hello, Auntie!

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:31.266
Please vote number 5, Chief Peng.

00:18:31.266 --> 00:18:33.790
Let the new gen run the island.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.654
Stop voting for the same old family.
It's outdated.

00:18:37.108 --> 00:18:37.608
Hey.

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:38.417
Number 5, please.

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:39.638
You even said that?

00:18:39.999 --> 00:18:41.173
Aren't you breaking the rule?

00:18:41.397 --> 00:18:42.882
We have to be direct.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.784
Still, we have to respect
everyone's right to choose.

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:47.935
They'll vote for Uncle Peng anyway, right?

00:18:48.142 --> 00:18:50.709
Auntie, vote number 5.

00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:54.164
As I told you,
please choose someone new gen
to improve the island.

00:18:54.164 --> 00:18:55.026
Auntie, please vote number 5.

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:57.013
Vote number 5, please.

00:18:57.013 --> 00:18:59.496
- I'll buy them all.
- Thank you.

00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:01.802
- Vote number 5, please.
- I'll buy them all!

00:19:01.802 --> 00:19:03.795
- Vote number 5, please.
- I'll buy from your shop.

00:19:03.795 --> 00:19:04.605
Ugh, so noisy!

00:19:05.053 --> 00:19:06.268
I'm buying stuff.

00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:08.599
I'd never vote for him.

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:09.409
Eh?

00:19:09.564 --> 00:19:10.414
Come on, Auntie.

00:19:10.724 --> 00:19:12.863
Don't you want to give the new gen
a chance to improve the island?

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:17.179
I do, but I don't want
a faggot village head.

00:19:17.472 --> 00:19:21.117
Men who like men shouldn't have that role.

00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:22.698
What's wrong with that, Auntie?

00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:25.420
What does that have to do
with running the island?

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.324
It's a completely separate matter, isn't it?

00:19:26.444 --> 00:19:27.703
It's never happened before.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.455
Big positions here always
go to men with wives and kids.

00:19:31.455 --> 00:19:34.226
Those men with wives and kids
are the ones who corrupt.

00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:37.491
Roads cracked, bridges broken,
trash piled high—

00:19:37.491 --> 00:19:39.224
all thanks to married men with kids!

00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:40.332
Don't vote for him.

00:19:40.332 --> 00:19:44.193
If you do, the island's doomed for sure.

00:19:44.193 --> 00:19:46.169
You don't want to vote, fine,

00:19:46.169 --> 00:19:47.838
but stop telling others not to.

00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:48.629
That's outdated!

00:19:48.629 --> 00:19:49.649
It's why this island never grows!

00:19:51.427 --> 00:19:52.560
You brat!

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.372
Your uncle taught you that mouth?

00:19:55.372 --> 00:19:56.202
I don't need anyone to teach me.

00:19:56.202 --> 00:19:59.077
I already know I have to be mouthy
with a crazy, foul-mouthed person like you!

00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:02.789
- Auntie, you can't do this!
- Hey, stop!

00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:04.483
Peng will never be our village head!

00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:06.199
And you won't die of old age!

00:20:06.199 --> 00:20:07.713
Ahhh!

00:20:07.868 --> 00:20:08.609
Stop it!

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.768
- Stop already!
- You crazy, foul-mouthed auntie!

00:20:11.768 --> 00:20:12.269
Stop it!

00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:39.662
OUTDATED

00:21:43.332 --> 00:21:43.832
Hey!

00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:49.591
Why did you follow me?

00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:54.750
If I didn't, I wouldn't see
you risking Uncle Peng's disqualification!.

00:21:56.454 --> 00:21:57.458
They played dirty too.

00:21:57.596 --> 00:21:58.524
And nothing happens to them.

00:21:59.178 --> 00:22:00.768
Still, we have to do things right.

00:22:01.336 --> 00:22:02.652
Even if they cheat,

00:22:03.203 --> 00:22:04.717
we shouldn't stoop to that.

00:22:05.956 --> 00:22:09.638
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

00:22:09.793 --> 00:22:11.792
But I believe in fair play.

00:22:12.825 --> 00:22:15.992
If we win, we'll be proud we've done it clean.

00:22:16.853 --> 00:22:20.232
If we lose, at least we've tried our best.

00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:37.349
Don't do this again, okay?

00:22:37.762 --> 00:22:38.369
I was worried.

00:22:40.056 --> 00:22:41.471
I worry about you too.

00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:44.274
Don't worry about me.

00:22:44.687 --> 00:22:45.869
I can take care of myself.

00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:48.355
I'm more worried you'll be in danger.

00:22:50.093 --> 00:22:51.606
And what is the difference between us?

00:22:52.502 --> 00:22:53.169
Why?

00:22:53.636 --> 00:22:55.524
Can't you be shot? Can't you be stabbed?

00:22:57.916 --> 00:22:58.500
Forget about it.

00:22:59.602 --> 00:23:02.701
Just don't go anywhere alone again.

00:23:02.701 --> 00:23:05.406
I'll be with you all the time, day and night.

00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:07.674
Hey, that's a bit too much.

00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:09.811
You're acting like my bodyguard.

00:23:17.192 --> 00:23:18.844
That's because I'm your boyfriend.

00:23:25.152 --> 00:23:25.837
Let's go home.

00:23:34.617 --> 00:23:37.030
I like it when you're stubborn,

00:23:38.631 --> 00:23:40.958
but next time, tell me first.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.555
I want to be stubborn with you.

00:23:48.189 --> 00:23:49.234
Alright, my boyfriend.

00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:50.009
Let's go.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.199
Wait.

00:24:15.191 --> 00:24:17.260
The world needs love.

00:24:19.756 --> 00:24:20.379
Let's go home.

00:24:39.316 --> 00:24:42.079
Hello everyone.

00:24:42.423 --> 00:24:46.409
ELECTION SPEECH
BANGSAWAN ISLAND HEAD
I'm Chettha, number 2.

00:24:46.838 --> 00:24:49.823
Please vote for me
to be your village head.

00:24:50.209 --> 00:24:51.868
My family has always served this community,

00:24:52.469 --> 00:24:57.603
as headmen, subdistrict chiefs,
and village officers.

00:24:57.861 --> 00:25:01.024
I think our island has come so far.

00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:10.189
Let's not let an outsider,
who is abnormal, tarnish our home!

00:25:13.753 --> 00:25:16.035
CHETTHA IS THE ANSWER
TO PROGRESS.

00:25:16.035 --> 00:25:20.178
- Number 2! Number 2! Number 2!
- Number 2! Number 2! Number 2!

00:25:20.178 --> 00:25:21.145
Are you okay, uncle?

00:25:23.314 --> 00:25:24.488
I'm fine.

00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:26.763
Don't mind what they say.

00:25:27.085 --> 00:25:28.713
People will always talk.

00:25:28.713 --> 00:25:31.692
We're here to sell policies, not dreams

00:25:32.229 --> 00:25:33.642
You think that's enough?

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:39.521
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:25:46.413 --> 00:25:47.329
What do we do?

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.092
I'm worried he'll mess up.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.410
He's probably stressed from all the gossip.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.080
He's sweating and his hands are shaking.

00:25:53.209 --> 00:25:56.978
If he freezes up there,
he'll lose credibility with the locals.

00:25:57.751 --> 00:25:59.920
I think it's better to withdraw for now.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.048
Let's say he's got an upset stomach.

00:26:01.392 --> 00:26:02.454
No way.

00:26:03.113 --> 00:26:06.551
There must be a better way.

00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:07.506
Like what?

00:26:23.502 --> 00:26:24.615
Are you sure this is a good idea?

00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:26.799
We won't know until we try.

00:26:27.465 --> 00:26:29.292
Fine, let's do it. Come on.

00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:52.738
My policy is to develop our economy
alongside preserving nature.

00:26:52.974 --> 00:26:54.959
We'll maintain the island's tradition.

00:26:54.959 --> 00:26:58.364
We can grow without losing who we are.

00:27:02.272 --> 00:27:06.314
We'll open for tourism, for parties,

00:27:10.093 --> 00:27:11.410
but we must..

00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:14.963
We must preserve...

00:27:18.699 --> 00:27:20.507
We must preserve the environment...

00:27:22.654 --> 00:27:23.556
We'll…

00:27:26.304 --> 00:27:27.283
We'll…

00:27:35.556 --> 00:27:38.595
That's all for now. Please vote for number 5.

00:27:49.503 --> 00:27:51.437
Wait, wait!

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:52.964
Uncle Peng, hold on!

00:27:57.332 --> 00:27:59.097
Everyone, it's not over yet!

00:27:59.097 --> 00:28:00.565
Please listen to my uncle!
There's more!

00:28:01.037 --> 00:28:02.957
Lava, what are you doing?

00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:03.973
Give me the mic!

00:28:13.535 --> 00:28:14.356
Hurry!

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:21.186
Everyone, my uncle isn't someone
who brags about himself.

00:28:21.594 --> 00:28:24.085
If I say it, you'll think I'm exaggerating,

00:28:24.622 --> 00:28:26.941
so I'll let people
who've worked with him speak instead.

00:28:27.194 --> 00:28:28.021
Please come in.

00:28:38.574 --> 00:28:39.321
Uncle.

00:28:39.904 --> 00:28:41.605
Uncle, please talk.

00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:42.737
Sure.

00:28:47.324 --> 00:28:52.003
Mr. Peng was the one
who started inviting tourists to the island.

00:28:52.003 --> 00:28:55.044
They also help collect trash
and protect our island.

00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:08.293
Chief gives jobs to locals everywhere,

00:29:08.996 --> 00:29:12.556
even to people no one else would hire,
like heavily pregnant women.

00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:20.774
I used to be a drug addict.

00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:24.257
I had no future, dropped out of school.

00:29:24.686 --> 00:29:28.312
He was the only one who gave me a chance.

00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:32.099
He got me a job, helped me quit drug,

00:29:32.314 --> 00:29:33.556
sent me back to school,

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.492
and changed my life.

00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:39.712
Now I have a goal.

00:29:39.712 --> 00:29:42.418
I'll become a 100-million-follower influencer!

00:29:52.684 --> 00:29:57.609
The chance I got from Uncle Peng
is the chance to keep living.

00:29:58.167 --> 00:29:59.836
I don't even know who I am
and where I came from,

00:30:00.867 --> 00:30:04.974
but he opened his heart
and welcomed me into his family,

00:30:05.661 --> 00:30:07.351
so that I could have a new life.

00:30:08.167 --> 00:30:10.080
He never asked for anything in return

00:30:12.764 --> 00:30:14.989
I've seen how hard he works

00:30:16.127 --> 00:30:19.519
and how he never judges anyone
by gender or education.

00:30:20.056 --> 00:30:23.974
His personal life doesn't make him
less capable.

00:30:24.876 --> 00:30:26.309
But it makes him stronger

00:30:27.082 --> 00:30:30.110
because he's had to fight for acceptance.

00:30:31.506 --> 00:30:35.129
So please, give Uncle Peng the chance
to give this island a new life

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:39.392
like he gave me mine.

00:30:44.696 --> 00:30:46.776
This is 10 out of 10!

00:30:46.916 --> 00:30:48.457
We have to vote number 5.

00:30:52.322 --> 00:31:11.501
- Number 5! Number 5! Number 5!
- Number 5! Number 5! Number 5!

00:31:11.501 --> 00:31:12.489
This was your doing, huh?

00:31:14.701 --> 00:31:16.193
It's the prince's idea.

00:31:52.773 --> 00:31:53.881
You're smoking again?

00:31:59.721 --> 00:32:01.480
Hey, what are you doing?

00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:06.711
Don't smoke. It's bad for you.

00:32:09.824 --> 00:32:12.517
If it's bad, then why do you still smoke?

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.607
You know what? I hate the smell.

00:32:21.996 --> 00:32:24.455
But I let it go because it's you.

00:32:30.897 --> 00:32:32.272
I can quit for you.

00:32:34.655 --> 00:32:35.977
Don't do it for me.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.901
Do it for yourself.

00:32:42.014 --> 00:32:44.545
You should care about yourself more.

00:32:45.425 --> 00:32:48.462
You always act like
you don't care about anyone,

00:32:49.235 --> 00:32:50.289
but deep down,

00:32:50.847 --> 00:32:52.687
you really care about others' feelings.

00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:54.764
Since I got here,

00:32:55.215 --> 00:32:58.352
I've seen you do more for others
than for yourself.

00:33:00.843 --> 00:33:02.673
I'm not that good.

00:33:04.262 --> 00:33:05.760
I'm just saying what I feel.

00:33:14.874 --> 00:33:17.653
If Uncle Peng doesn't win, what do we do?

00:33:20.874 --> 00:33:23.869
He'll win. I believe that.

00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:27.895
It'd be awful, right?

00:33:30.386 --> 00:33:31.771
Loving each other that much

00:33:32.286 --> 00:33:33.478
but not being able to stay together.

00:33:37.021 --> 00:33:38.403
Love is so hard

00:33:39.996 --> 00:33:42.042
even though it's supposed to be
just between two people.

00:34:18.687 --> 00:34:20.278
Take it easy, Tum!

00:34:21.115 --> 00:34:22.299
Running away, huh?

00:34:55.952 --> 00:34:58.206
Kratae, can you grab me
some soap or lotion?

00:34:58.206 --> 00:34:59.466
Okay, okay.

00:34:59.466 --> 00:35:00.879
Poor Wave, man.

00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:02.595
It's that bad, huh?

00:35:07.512 --> 00:35:08.583
Take it slow.

00:35:11.997 --> 00:35:15.372
Yay! Nice job, Lava!

00:35:15.694 --> 00:35:17.716
You look like Cinderella.

00:35:19.756 --> 00:35:21.311
Come on, keep playing.

00:35:21.311 --> 00:35:22.744
Keep playing!

00:35:32.487 --> 00:35:33.922
You're covered in powder like a dog.

00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:37.157
I want some, too.

00:35:39.712 --> 00:35:41.133
I just didn't want anyone else touching you.

00:35:45.256 --> 00:35:47.935
Hey, stop!

00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:49.520
I don't want to play. Songkran's over!

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.288
No way.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.719
You rushed me back,

00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:53.843
so you have to keep playing with me.

00:35:55.475 --> 00:35:58.155
Come on, I was just worried
you'd hurt your feet.

00:35:58.155 --> 00:36:00.127
Your shoes were biting.

00:36:00.234 --> 00:36:01.117
Don't be dramatic.

00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:02.698
I haven't had enough fun yet.

00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:04.054
So…

00:36:06.008 --> 00:36:07.255
Oh yeah? You asked for it!

00:36:08.436 --> 00:36:10.547
Take this!

00:36:13.596 --> 00:36:14.872
Come here!

00:36:16.354 --> 00:36:17.604
Stop it!

00:36:17.604 --> 00:36:18.739
Hey!

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:21.264
Shit, my bag!

00:36:22.917 --> 00:36:23.550
Jay!

00:36:29.068 --> 00:36:31.047
When did you get here?
Why didn't you tell me?

00:36:31.154 --> 00:36:32.738
I wanted to surprise you.

00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:34.875
And yeah, damn surprise!

00:36:34.875 --> 00:36:36.160
My bag's soaked.

00:36:38.092 --> 00:36:40.819
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

00:36:43.503 --> 00:36:45.996
Wave, this is Jay,

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.189
my friend from Bangkok.

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:51.646
And this is Wave….

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.900
He's my friend.

00:37:00.378 --> 00:37:01.047
Hi.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:04.946
Hey.

00:37:05.268 --> 00:37:08.525
I came for the party. Take me around.

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:10.973
I work all the time.

00:37:11.209 --> 00:37:12.269
I don't really go out.

00:37:12.655 --> 00:37:14.500
Come on, man.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.573
I came all this way. Let's make it epic.

00:37:18.806 --> 00:37:19.915
Come on.

00:37:24.703 --> 00:37:26.763
Why didn't you tell him I'm your boyfriend?

00:37:28.567 --> 00:37:30.157
I didn't want to answer his questions.

00:37:30.157 --> 00:37:31.072
He asks a lot.

00:37:31.523 --> 00:37:34.092
No matter what he asks,
I can answer everything.

00:37:35.123 --> 00:37:38.101
I don't want us to be “friends” one day
and “boyfriends” the next.

00:37:38.552 --> 00:37:42.186
Our status should stay the same,
no matter who's around.

00:37:42.186 --> 00:37:44.508
My apologies, Your Highness.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.596
I won't upset you again.

00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:49.808
What are you saying?

00:37:52.664 --> 00:37:53.808
I'm just teasing.

00:37:57.072 --> 00:37:59.570
Then can I come with you tonight?

00:38:00.257 --> 00:38:04.340
No. You don't like drinking or parties.

00:38:04.555 --> 00:38:05.428
You won't have fun.

00:38:06.008 --> 00:38:08.653
It's not your thing.

00:38:08.997 --> 00:38:10.996
But this island's famous for its parties.

00:38:11.254 --> 00:38:12.687
I've never been to one.

00:38:13.975 --> 00:38:14.984
You can't come.

00:38:14.984 --> 00:38:16.638
There're too many drunk people.
It's dangerous.

00:38:19.966 --> 00:38:23.096
Why are you so overprotective lately?

00:38:24.148 --> 00:38:25.578
Whatever I want to do,

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:28.168
you always find a reason to stop me.

00:38:38.067 --> 00:38:39.540
Even if we're dating,

00:38:39.996 --> 00:38:41.801
you can't control my life.

00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:47.425
I'm just worried about you.

00:38:54.575 --> 00:38:59.689
Then keep me in your sight all the time.
Wouldn't that be better?

00:39:11.649 --> 00:39:13.106
Whoa!

00:39:21.436 --> 00:39:23.328
Cheers!

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:24.648
Yeah!

00:39:33.436 --> 00:39:34.365
How do I look?

00:39:35.635 --> 00:39:38.842
Handsome, but something's missing.

00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:40.516
What's missing?

00:40:09.762 --> 00:40:12.396
Are you drunk yet?

00:40:12.396 --> 00:40:13.403
Not yet.

00:40:14.116 --> 00:40:16.265
I still want to have fun with you.

00:40:16.265 --> 00:40:18.773
And I want your friend to like me.

00:40:18.996 --> 00:40:22.066
No need. He's only here for a little while.

00:40:22.066 --> 00:40:23.287
He's leaving soon anyway.

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:24.206
No way.

00:40:24.652 --> 00:40:27.867
I want my boyfriend's friend to like me.

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:31.186
Fine, whatever.

00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:33.072
But if you want to leave, just tell me.

00:40:33.072 --> 00:40:33.995
I'll take you home.

00:40:33.995 --> 00:40:36.410
I told you not to act like my bodyguard.

00:40:37.212 --> 00:40:38.852
Just act like my boyfriend.

00:40:40.234 --> 00:40:42.813
Easy! That hurts.

00:40:42.813 --> 00:40:44.129
You're too cute.

00:40:46.425 --> 00:40:47.352
Come here.

00:41:15.774 --> 00:41:17.058
Hey, Lava.

00:41:18.039 --> 00:41:20.188
I just saw Wave kiss your cheek.

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:22.313
Are you sure you're just friends?

00:41:22.536 --> 00:41:23.594
He's not a friend.

00:41:23.772 --> 00:41:25.224
He's my boyfriend.

00:41:27.163 --> 00:41:28.356
Okay, okay.

00:41:28.356 --> 00:41:29.317
That's it.

00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:32.000
I didn't expect your type to be like that.

00:41:32.796 --> 00:41:35.853
He's exactly my type,
both looks and personality.

00:41:36.566 --> 00:41:37.352
Really?

00:41:37.508 --> 00:41:40.466
I remember
your one-night stands weren't like this.

00:41:41.514 --> 00:41:43.614
Hey, come on.

00:41:43.614 --> 00:41:45.338
People change, man.

00:41:45.338 --> 00:41:46.296
I've changed.

00:41:46.697 --> 00:41:48.449
Okay, fine.

00:41:51.859 --> 00:41:54.151
Hey, Lava, do you want to try?

00:41:55.199 --> 00:41:56.453
It's got a great vibe.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.272
No, I'll just drink. I'll get drunk anyway.
You go ahead.

00:41:59.272 --> 00:42:00.515
Come on, just a bit!

00:42:00.515 --> 00:42:01.181
Come.

00:42:01.574 --> 00:42:02.516
No, Jay, stop.

00:42:03.252 --> 00:42:04.077
Hey.

00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:06.884
You bastard!

00:42:07.076 --> 00:42:08.810
It's gone. You have to pay for it.

00:42:08.921 --> 00:42:10.075
For what?

00:42:10.209 --> 00:42:12.935
That's drugs. Should I call the cops?

00:42:12.935 --> 00:42:14.102
Are you threatening me, huh?

00:42:14.116 --> 00:42:14.822
Hey!

00:42:16.436 --> 00:42:17.776
Don't touch my boyfriend.

00:42:17.776 --> 00:42:21.248
You'd choose your new boyfriend
over your friend of four years?

00:42:21.248 --> 00:42:22.937
It doesn't matter how long.

00:42:23.204 --> 00:42:25.428
He makes my life better. Got it?

00:42:25.516 --> 00:42:27.376
You're not fun anymore, man.

00:42:27.889 --> 00:42:29.145
I shouldn't have come.

00:42:29.256 --> 00:42:29.935
Shit.

00:42:36.778 --> 00:42:37.429
Let's go.

00:42:46.524 --> 00:42:50.080
I'm sorry you fought with your friend
because of me.

00:42:51.618 --> 00:42:52.466
It's fine.

00:42:53.692 --> 00:42:55.272
Jay's always been like that.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.156
I just don't want you using drugs.

00:43:02.758 --> 00:43:03.853
I'm not.

00:43:05.146 --> 00:43:06.309
Don't you trust me?

00:43:13.464 --> 00:43:15.886
I don't want that life anymore—

00:43:17.223 --> 00:43:19.062
drinking hard, acting out to hurt my mom,

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:22.316
doing everything to show her
I was in pain after I was abandoned.

00:43:24.055 --> 00:43:26.997
I got to a point
where I didn't care about myself.

00:43:28.379 --> 00:43:30.134
And she still didn't care either.

00:43:32.006 --> 00:43:33.408
That kind of life…

00:43:36.818 --> 00:43:38.082
was meaningless.

00:43:41.938 --> 00:43:44.176
I like seeing you
when you're vulnerable like this.

00:43:44.599 --> 00:43:48.233
You're the only one
who gets to see me like this.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.656
I'm sorry.

00:44:58.102 --> 00:44:59.529
I drank too much last night.

00:44:59.685 --> 00:45:01.841
Tell Wave I'm sorry too.

00:45:03.535 --> 00:45:05.042
He's not mad at you.

00:45:06.179 --> 00:45:07.406
Can I ask you something?

00:45:08.253 --> 00:45:09.256
Who is he, anyway?

00:45:09.791 --> 00:45:11.589
How did he change you this much?

00:45:15.846 --> 00:45:16.916
He's a prince.

00:45:17.139 --> 00:45:19.049
I saved him on the beach.

00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:22.049
Huh? Asshole!

00:45:22.049 --> 00:45:22.863
I'm asking nicely here.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.784
You sound like you're in a mermaid movie.

00:45:24.784 --> 00:45:26.118
Eh? I'm serious.

00:45:26.296 --> 00:45:27.431
Believe it or not.

00:45:27.596 --> 00:45:29.847
Well, enjoy your life with your prince then.

00:45:30.649 --> 00:45:33.807
If you're ever back in Bangkok,
you can stay at my place.

00:45:35.947 --> 00:45:37.465
Not anytime soon.

00:45:37.755 --> 00:45:38.922
I've got an important job.

00:45:40.594 --> 00:45:41.442
What is it?

00:45:47.772 --> 00:45:49.404
Taking care of my prince.

00:45:53.661 --> 00:45:55.338
Lava!

00:46:00.947 --> 00:46:03.389
You got this, Lava!

00:46:03.946 --> 00:46:05.330
Go, go!

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:07.265
Hit him!

00:46:25.655 --> 00:46:26.366
Punch!

00:46:33.581 --> 00:46:34.836
Go, go!

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:53.131
Yay!

00:47:11.769 --> 00:47:12.996
If Tum hadn't told me,

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:15.056
I'd never know you box.

00:47:15.814 --> 00:47:17.058
I didn't want to stress you out.

00:47:17.058 --> 00:47:18.584
You're busy with the election.

00:47:18.807 --> 00:47:19.991
I can multitask.

00:47:19.991 --> 00:47:20.826
Don't worry.

00:47:21.918 --> 00:47:24.895
And if you need money for that motorbike,
you can tell me.

00:47:25.162 --> 00:47:26.424
I can lend it.

00:47:27.784 --> 00:47:28.634
No need.

00:47:28.968 --> 00:47:30.619
Winning this way feels more satisfying.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.198
Save your money for your wedding.

00:47:34.647 --> 00:47:37.133
I don't know if there'll even be one.

00:47:38.582 --> 00:47:39.827
You've got to fight for it.

00:47:39.827 --> 00:47:40.768
Go for it.

00:47:44.022 --> 00:47:48.180
But I didn't know
you were this good at boxing.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.412
I'm hurting, you know.

00:47:56.357 --> 00:47:57.642
I've been keeping fit.

00:47:57.865 --> 00:48:00.846
I have to be ready to be
Prince Davin's royal guard.

00:48:02.272 --> 00:48:03.499
How are you feeling these days?

00:48:04.502 --> 00:48:05.375
Awful.

00:48:05.776 --> 00:48:07.286
I feel uncomfortable having to lie to him.

00:48:08.222 --> 00:48:09.233
I get it.

00:48:09.436 --> 00:48:10.910
You've already fallen for him.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.030
It's hard to let go.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.176
Can't I just not let go?

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.463
How?

00:48:18.444 --> 00:48:19.680
Do you think it's possible?

00:48:20.059 --> 00:48:21.662
You're just an ordinary guy.

00:48:21.662 --> 00:48:23.198
He's even a prince.

00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:27.237
But they'll come for him soon.

00:48:28.597 --> 00:48:30.126
I want you to be ready for that, okay?

00:48:32.979 --> 00:48:34.250
Who'd believe it, right?

00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:37.002
My boyfriend is a prince.

00:48:38.718 --> 00:48:42.551
Prince Davin of Arantha.

00:49:11.837 --> 00:49:12.982
What did you say?

00:49:17.774 --> 00:49:18.905
I'm a prince?

00:49:29.887 --> 00:49:33.909
Everything you've heard from Mr. Peng
and Mr. Lava is true, Your Highness.

00:49:34.533 --> 00:49:37.931
You're Prince Davin Evarech Delloy
of Arantha,

00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:40.382
the next heir to the throne of Arantha.

00:49:44.149 --> 00:49:46.252
Then who are you?

00:49:46.832 --> 00:49:48.042
Aren't you Natee?

00:49:48.644 --> 00:49:51.086
I'm sorry for lying, Your Highness.

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.240
My name is Paolo.

00:49:53.507 --> 00:49:55.469
I'm a royal guard of Arantha.

00:49:55.876 --> 00:50:00.285
Princess Anya sent me to the island
to make sure you were safe.

00:50:04.698 --> 00:50:06.010
Please help my brother.

00:50:09.041 --> 00:50:10.167
What about my family?

00:50:10.903 --> 00:50:13.287
They're still being held captive,

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.615
but don't worry.

00:50:14.905 --> 00:50:17.810
I'm following Princess Anya's orders,

00:50:18.523 --> 00:50:20.924
and they'll soon be free.

00:50:24.468 --> 00:50:28.306
You're not just teaming up
to play a joke on me, are you?

00:50:34.079 --> 00:50:35.894
Everything I said is true.

00:50:36.964 --> 00:50:39.167
For now, please stay where you are.

00:50:39.769 --> 00:50:43.493
I trust that Mr. Peng and Mr. Lava
will take good care of you.

00:51:23.807 --> 00:51:25.362
How long have you known about this?

00:51:26.878 --> 00:51:28.134
For two or three weeks.

00:51:29.494 --> 00:51:30.557
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:51:30.557 --> 00:51:33.869
Paolo told me not to. It's for your safety.

00:51:34.047 --> 00:51:35.813
So everything that happened…

00:51:37.239 --> 00:51:38.401
you lied to me, didn't you?

00:51:39.315 --> 00:51:40.424
That's not true, Your Highness.

00:51:40.424 --> 00:51:41.207
Then explain it to me.

00:51:42.946 --> 00:51:43.940
Taking care of me,

00:51:45.901 --> 00:51:47.029
being nice to me,

00:51:50.172 --> 00:51:51.467
being my boyfriend,

00:51:53.228 --> 00:51:54.434
making me fall in love with you—

00:51:55.593 --> 00:51:56.924
were they all orders too?

00:51:59.933 --> 00:52:01.006
Was any of it real?

00:52:01.006 --> 00:52:02.355
Please, Your Highness, listen to me.

00:52:02.355 --> 00:52:03.261
I'm not a prince!

00:52:05.512 --> 00:52:06.620
I'm Wave.

00:52:08.537 --> 00:52:09.886
Even if you tell me who I am,

00:52:10.867 --> 00:52:12.418
I still can't remember anything.

00:52:14.045 --> 00:52:15.344
No matter what, I'm Wave,

00:52:16.369 --> 00:52:17.723
Nava Mahasamut.

00:52:23.953 --> 00:52:24.620
Or what?

00:52:26.601 --> 00:52:30.649
Someone came up with that name
for me too?

00:52:32.856 --> 00:52:33.911
I came up with it myself.

00:52:35.538 --> 00:52:37.064
I don't even know what to believe anymore!

00:52:40.608 --> 00:52:42.486
Losing my memory hurt enough,

00:52:50.883 --> 00:52:52.189
but now this hurts even more.

00:52:58.585 --> 00:53:00.549
Your… Your Highness,
please hear me out.

00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:01.571
I'm telling the truth.

00:53:36.516 --> 00:53:39.358
You're a prince. How could you do this?

00:53:39.358 --> 00:53:40.903
I never wanted to be a prince.

00:53:41.594 --> 00:53:42.884
I'd rather be Wave.

00:53:43.156 --> 00:53:44.755
From now on, there'll be no hiding.

00:53:44.755 --> 00:53:47.052
We'll love each other openly. Everyone on the island will know.

00:53:49.437 --> 00:53:50.053
Mom!

00:53:50.588 --> 00:53:51.371
Who's this?

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:55.466
I promise, no matter what happens,

00:53:55.466 --> 00:53:57.651
I'll do everything to stay with you, my boyfriend.

00:53:57.874 --> 00:53:59.516
I promise too.
