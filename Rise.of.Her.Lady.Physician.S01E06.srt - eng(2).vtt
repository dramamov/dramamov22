00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.560
A storm is coming.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.000
Quickly store the herbs properly

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280
and lock the doors and windows.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.160
If any herbs get damp or damaged,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.520
I won't go easy on you.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.960
Aye.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.320
(Rong Zelan,)

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.960
(today, I'll let you know
what price you have to pay)

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.520
(for competing with me.)

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.120
Attendant Rong.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.120
It occurred to me

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.040
that I left my dress drying in the yard.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.480
If it gets drenched,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.960
what will I wear tomorrow?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.920
I need to take it in.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.320
Please tidy up the herbs here.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.880
Okay.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.120
Remember to close the doors and windows.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.040
Okay.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.320
Oh.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.600
You've come at the right time.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.040
It's raining now,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.080
and my new dress
is still hanging in the yard.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.560
If it gets wet in the rain,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.040
it'll delay my duty tomorrow.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.800
Thankfully, Attendant Rong
told me to take it in.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.400
However,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.600
she has to finish the work
at the Imperial Pharmacy herself.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.200
She must be tired.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.080
How could she be tired?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.160
How tiring could it be
to tidy up some herbs?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.240
Attendant Feng,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.980
you're just too kind-hearted.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.080
Exactly.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.920
Don't say that.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200
We're all colleagues.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.760
Let's go.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.720
Okay.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.480
(I looked through the case records
over the years)

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.200
(but didn't find any clues concerning)

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.640
(the consorts' children.)

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.440
(It seems)

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.920
(I need to change my approach.)

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.900
(Consorts' Cases)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.920
It's raining more heavily.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.570
Fortunately, I closed
the doors and windows in time.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.270
If the heavy rain fell into
the Imperial Pharmacy,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.790
it'd be a disaster.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.040
Lord Song.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.160
Glad to see you again.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600
This rain came suddenly.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.280
You have no umbrella.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.240
If you don't mind,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.480
we can share an umbrella.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.720
No need.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.000
You've finished work,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.280
so go back and rest early.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.040
Then I'll take my leave.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.040
Consort Li is gravely ill

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.920
and urgently needs Huoshan Dendrobium.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.360
Now this batch of medicinal materials
has been soaked by rain

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.720
and cannot be used.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.160
What should we do?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.560
Who was on duty last night?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.880
It rained so heavily.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.800
I can't believe
you left the windows open!

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.200
What on earth are you all doing?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.480
Minister Wu, Minister Feng, forgive me.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.400
Attendant Rong and I
were on duty yesterday.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.800
I left early to
take my dress into my room.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.120
Before I left, I told her to make sure
all windows and doors were closed.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.320
Who'd have thought that the windows
were wide open this morning?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.640
She must've

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.200
made a mistake in a hurry,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.400
so all the medicinal materials got wet.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.280
No way.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.320
How's that possible?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.960
Attendant Feng, what do you mean?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.250
Are you saying
that the herbs got wet because

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.560
I didn't close the windows?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.140
Last night,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.400
Attendant Feng
returned to the dormitory with us.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.440
If not you, who else could it be?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.800
Exactly.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.880
We...

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.680
W-We went back together.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.440
(I knew it.)

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.720
(Feng Yin made an excuse to leave)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.320
(so that she could use the heavy rain
to set me up.)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.080
(Petty tricks.)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.400
(My backup plan can finally be of use.)

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.080
When I left the Imperial Pharmacy,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.240
they were all closed,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.000
and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.440
Lord Song can testify for me.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.960
Officer Song,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.000
is she telling the truth?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.160
Well...

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.300
Fortunately, I closed
the doors and windows in time.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.960
If the heavy rain fell into
the Imperial Pharmacy,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.760
it'd be a disaster.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.040
(No wonder she was so kind,
offering to share)

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.320
(an umbrella with me.)

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.520
(It turns out it was her plan.)

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.680
Manure-prepared Licorice.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.360
Minister Wu,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.600
last night, I passed by
the Imperial Pharmacy

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.640
and saw the doors and windows

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.360
tightly closed when she left.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.760
Everything was in place.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.200
Last night, I met you at the Case Room

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.480
at a quarter to eight.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.240
Did you see Rong Zelan

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.920
leave the Imperial Pharmacy before that?

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.280
Exactly.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.680
At almost eight o'clock,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.480
I left the Case Room.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.680
When I passed by the Imperial Pharmacy,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.840
I saw someone push the door open
and enter the room.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.920
That figure...

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.320
That figure looked like Attendant Feng.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.200
It was her!

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.840
In other words,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.760
after I closed the doors and windows
and left,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.320
you went to
open them again secretly, right?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.720
It wasn't me.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.840
I did leave my room last night,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.770
but I didn't go to the pharmacy

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.330
but the latrine in the northwest corner.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.640
Is that so?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.360
If I remember correctly,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.640
you usually use the chamber pot.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.200
Why would you go to

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.840
the latrine in such heavy rain?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.160
Whether I use a chamber pot
or a latrine

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.040
is none of your business.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.360
Why are you panicking?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.720
Who says I'm panicking?

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.360
Don't slander me.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.560
Attendant Feng,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.480
when I closed the doors and windows
and left the pharmacy,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.880
I applied the juniper ointment

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.920
I had just prepared on

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.760
every door and window.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.200
The person who went to open them

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.480
hurriedly in the dark

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
wouldn't have noticed it.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.710
I'm sure this person's sleeve

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.200
still has oil stains from the ointment.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.840
Oh.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.880
Attendant Feng,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.080
why do the brown oil stains
on your sleeve

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.440
look so much like my juniper ointment?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.960
Feng Yin,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.960
now the evidence is clear.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.280
You deliberately damaged
the herbs in the palace

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.680
and framed your colleague.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.480
What punishment do you deserve?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.920
Uncle, help me!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.880
Uncle!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.240
Help me!

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.360
Help me!

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.120
Help me, Uncle!

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.720
Shut up!

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.160
You committed a crime.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.320
How dare you beg me?

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.920
The most important thing now
is to find Huoshan Dendrobium.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.600
Officer Li,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.960
is there not a single piece of
usable Huoshan Dendrobium left?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.040
Minister Wu,
it was all drenched by the rain,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.800
no stock in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.160
Can we find it outside the palace?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.240
Lord Wu,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.360
Huoshan Dendrobium is a rare material.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.880
It's hard to find it quickly
outside the palace.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.360
I'm afraid it's too late.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.320
What should we do now?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.280
If Consort Li's condition worsens,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.080
all of our lives combined
wouldn't be able to make up for it.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.480
What should we do?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.720
What should we do?

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.840
What should we do?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.000
Minister Wu, Consort Li
is extremely painful.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.120
Is the medicine ready?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.840
Minister Wu,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.500
I might have a way to restore
the effects of the damp herbs.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.980
- Really?
- Yes.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.840
Then tell us.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.200
What?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.920
Who got the herbs wet?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.110
If anything happens to Consort Li due to

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120
delayed use of medicine,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.760
I'll report it to His Majesty,
and he'll

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.280
execute the person's entire family.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.360
Minister Wu,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.820
if you fail to deliver the medicine

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.960
and delay the treatment,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.680
all of you will be punished!

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.640
What should we do now?

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.120
Attendant Rong!

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.720
Attendant Rong,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.960
are you sure you can solve it?

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.400
Please help me!

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.400
I apologize to you!

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.080
I'm sorry! I'm begging you!

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.160
Please help me!

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.760
As long as you can solve the problem,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.000
I'll do anything for you!

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.280
Please help me!

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.640
I shouldn't have held a grudge
over the pharmacy position!

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040
Please help me!

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.280
I'm sorry!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.960
Please help me, will you?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.160
Will you help me?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.480
I don't want to die!

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.720
Minister Wu.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.720
If I restore the effect
of the Huoshan Dendrobium,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.100
can I be promoted to
second-class medical attendant?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.880
Can she really solve it?

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.280
If she does, she should be promoted.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.600
(She stole an officer's clothes
and sneaked into the bathhouse,)

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.200
(and now she's asking for a promotion.)

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.400
(She is really bold.)

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.240
Lord Wu,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.400
saving Consort Li is the top priority.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.960
Rong Zelan,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.640
if you really solve the problem,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.040
we'll make an exception to promote you.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.880
Thanks, Minister Wu.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.360
Rong Zelan, I'm warning you.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.800
If you fail

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.560
and delay Consort Li's treatment,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.640
you'll be punished according to the rules

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.520
and expelled from the bureau.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.040
You must think it through.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.560
Okay, it's a deal.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.920
I need a lot of sulfur,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.970
charcoal,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.880
and fire starters.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.520
Officer Li, hurry up and get them!

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.640
Aye!

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.320
(You're so eager to be promoted.)

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.200
(Why exactly did you come here?)

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.200
It's choking.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.040
Will this work?

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.880
Minister Wu,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.120
it's done. Please take a look.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.320
Rong Zelan,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.080
sulfur is very toxic.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.080
A slight mishap
can turn it into arsenic.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.520
Do you know that?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.360
Lei Gong's Treatise on Drug Processing

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.240
says Dendrobium should avoid
fire and toxins.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.570
You are using poison against poison.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.560
If anything happens to Consort Li,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.200
can you afford the consequences?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.680
Zelan,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.240
is there any basis

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.440
for the method you used?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.840
Minister Wu,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.320
sulfur fumigation

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.600
can effectively remove
moisture from herbs.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.560
If Huoshan Dendrobium gets damp,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.880
it'll not only reduce its effects

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.480
but also cause mold spots.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.160
The gas produced by burning sulfur

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.800
can effectively remove mold spots

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.360
and ensure the quality.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.960
What's more, charcoal

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.240
can absorb the sulfur
remaining on the herbs

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.280
so that it won't make them toxic.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.800
Young as you are,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.560
you're so skilled and knowledgeable.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.780
May I ask

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.730
where you learned this method?

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.360
I've studied medicine

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.850
for a decade and offered
monthly free clinics to the people

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.320
to gain experience

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.160
and refine my skills.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.120
I learned this method from
an itinerant physician

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640
I met by chance.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.320
I see.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.680
It seems I'm so ignorant

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.000
that I've never seen
such an ingenious method.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.280
How can you ensure that there is
no sulfur poison at all?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.800
Attendant Feng.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.520
This is the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.880
We have all the outstanding physicians
in our country.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.440
It's not difficult

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.080
to test its toxicity, is it?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.760
I'm afraid I'll be promoted

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.730
to second-class attendant first.
