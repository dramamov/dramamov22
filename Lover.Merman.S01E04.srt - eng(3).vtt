[Lover Merman — Only Nava]
♫ We don't have to tell anyone ♫

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.990
I've been pursuing you for almost a month.
[Previously]

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.920
Why won't you warm up to me?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.630
Are you giving up already?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.500
I won't give up on you that easily.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.533
What about you? Do you believe in mermaids?

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.560
I do.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.780
And I also believe...

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.280
that merfolk
and humans can never coexist.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.470
Have a drink with me.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.960
But I'm still on the clock.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.960
If a customer asks you to drink, you drink.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.890
You didn't tell me you were coming.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.030
I was trying to surprise you.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.650
And I ended up getting a surprise of my own.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.000
The real reason I came was to talk to you
in person about our relationship.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.290
- I think--
- Let's break up.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.320
I saw the design you were sketching.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.120
So I had it custom-made for you.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.000
Nava, let me put it on for you.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.840
Where were you?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.920
Where I go is my--

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.140
I followed the car you and Phraphai were in.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.580
What did you say?

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120
That's Phraphai's car.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.730
Do you realize

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.620
that what you just did

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.150
is a complete invasion of my privacy?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.900
Can't you just tell me?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.455
Just tell me you feel something for me, too.

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:37.055
Oh, Phurich.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:38.900
You're awake.

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:48.700
I made you some hot porridge.
It'll help your hangover.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.400
If you're not hungry yet,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.611
I'll grab you some clothes to change into.

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:53.730
It's okay.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.688
I think I might've left some in the car.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.922
Is there something on my face?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.955
I was just thinking about last night.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.466
I'll go grab you some clothes to change into.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.190
♫ In love ♫

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.160
♫ Messy ♫

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.620
♫ My world ♫

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.220
♫ Our own new world together ♫

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.250
♫ Together ♫

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.120
♫ A line drawn under a forbidden love ♫

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.366
The porridge's really good.

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:05.055
This is far enough.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.540
Thanks for breakfast.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040
And for last night, too.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.460
Phurich.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.980
That's not funny.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.190
You've been dodging me all morning.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.030
I'm dying to talk about us.

00:05:24.977 --> 00:05:26.980
I know.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.200
But not right now.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.666
Alright then.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.100
See you this evening.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.533
Nava.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.920
Phurich.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.770
What are you doing with Nava so early?

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.980
- Last night, I--
- There was a small problem at the bar last night.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.711
He's here to talk about it.

00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.400
This early?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.900
You couldn't wait for Nava at the bar?

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.555
I'm impatient.

00:06:06.555 --> 00:06:08.911
Whatever I'm thinking

00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:10.840
or feeling,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.020
I want to talk about it.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.200
I don't like leaving things hanging.

00:06:18.433 --> 00:06:20.000
What about you?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.550
Why are you here so early?

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:25.933
It's a personal matter.

00:06:25.933 --> 00:06:29.788
An outsider like you doesn't need to know.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.211
Alright then,

00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.677
I'll take care of things
at the bar this evening.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.022
Okay.

00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:42.900
See you this evening.

00:06:58.888 --> 00:07:02.322
Nava, my dad wants to see you.

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.666
Let's get lunch together.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.933
Sure.

00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:09.977
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:12.577
- Hungry?
- Yes.

00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:13.977
Let's go.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.090
[Restaurant]

00:07:23.455 --> 00:07:25.950
Why are you here so early?

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.060
It's a personal matter.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.877
An outsider like you doesn't need to know.

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:37.311
This is so damn annoying.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.520
Hello, Phu.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.011
What's up, Than? I'm driving.

00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:49.940
I'm at the Khen Island pier now.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.177
Huh?

00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:53.760
What the hell? You're on the island already?

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.460
Come pick us up.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.270
Yu's here with me, too.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.360
What's this about?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.830
Some kind of surprise?

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.066
Or did Dad send you to make me go back to work?

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.820
Don't flatter yourself.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.522
We're just here for a little trip. That's all.

00:08:07.522 --> 00:08:10.190
What if I was busy? What would you do?

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.920
I don't care, big brother.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.980
Your little brothers are waiting at the pier,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.877
so call me when you get here.

00:08:15.877 --> 00:08:17.420
Bye-bye!

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.811
Totally cornered me.

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:33.577
You're still seasick, Than?

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.388
I felt a bit better when I got off the boat,

00:08:38.388 --> 00:08:41.355
but now the headache's back.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.444
Are you done taking pictures?

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:50.533
- Yes.
- Want to take some more photos?

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:52.011
I can take some for you.

00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:54.220
No, it's fine. You should rest.

00:08:55.677 --> 00:08:56.777
Alright.

00:08:56.777 --> 00:08:59.400
- I'll rest, then.
- Mm-hmm.

00:09:02.088 --> 00:09:03.344
Comfy.

00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:04.910
Are you actually seasick?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.540
You look suspicious.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.955
I'm really seasick. I can't take it anymore.

00:09:10.955 --> 00:09:12.844
Hey, not yet.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.600
It'll probably be a while before Phu gets here.

00:09:23.555 --> 00:09:26.066
I told you to call him yesterday.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.433
Who knows if he's sneaking off
to some island girl's place,

00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:32.455
that's why he's late.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.755
Since when do you know so much
about my private life, Than?

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.233
Hello, Phu.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.740
Than tricked you into coming, right, Yu?

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.790
Trick? Come on.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.990
- I've never tricked anyone in my life.
- Mm-hmm.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.422
Something like that.

00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:57.922
But don't worry,
I brought a lot of work to do, too.

00:09:57.922 --> 00:09:59.666
Did you forget something?

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:02.922
I'm no longer affiliated with the company.

00:10:02.922 --> 00:10:05.955
If you inherit less, don't whine about it.

00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:07.710
Geez.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.733
Anyway, Yu, if you love the sea,

00:10:10.733 --> 00:10:14.144
I'm telling you,
working on a beach on this island...

00:10:14.144 --> 00:10:16.577
Absolute paradise!

00:10:16.577 --> 00:10:18.010
I see.

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:20.744
The waves are rough these days.

00:10:20.744 --> 00:10:22.010
Did you get seasick?

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.610
Not at all, Phu.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.150
Hey, the seasick person's right here.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.200
You could see that from Mars.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.022
Won't you ask me?

00:10:33.011 --> 00:10:34.480
Let's go.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.430
I'll drop you off at your hotel.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.077
- Sure, Phu.
- Grab your bag, I'll carry it.

00:10:45.655 --> 00:10:47.911
Hey! I'm your real little brother!

00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:51.733
Do I need to wear a sign around my neck
to remind you?

00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:53.233
Geez.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.720
I'm coming too!

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.422
Wait up.

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.777
Nava,

00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:23.866
the food's not your liking today?

00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:26.133
I'm just not hungry today.

00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:30.755
Do you have to go back to work at the bar?

00:11:32.322 --> 00:11:33.922
Yes.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:37.122
Everything's going smoothly?

00:11:38.544 --> 00:11:42.488
Yes, business has been pretty busy lately.

00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:47.566
It'd be even better if no one bothered Nava.

00:11:48.688 --> 00:11:51.277
Someone's bothering him?

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.100
Who is it?

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.711
Um... Well...

00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:58.488
Phana's business partner, Phurich.

00:11:58.488 --> 00:12:00.700
He just came from Bangkok.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.400
He's pursuing Nava nonstop.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.120
Seems like he really likes Nava.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.130
But don't worry, Dad.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.011
I already told Nava that no human ever truly loves us.

00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:14.070
Humans just see us as monsters

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.760
or demons.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.166
There's a big difference between us and humans.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.890
I'd rather not meddle in your personal matters,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.444
but Phraphai is right about everything.

00:12:28.444 --> 00:12:34.244
Never forget what humans did to us 20 years ago.

00:12:37.477 --> 00:12:38.977
Yes.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.266
Even if we've dealt with the merman hunters,

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.411
they're still not finished.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.950
You know humans are greedy.

00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:55.600
If anything happens, tell Phraphai.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.200
Yes, Uncle.

00:13:19.177 --> 00:13:21.944
Hey, Nava,

00:13:21.944 --> 00:13:26.850
I'm sorry for bringing up Phurich during lunch.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.520
I just said it
because I'm really worried about you.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.480
I thought that if my dad said something,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.340
it'd make you stop and think for a bit.

00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:45.122
I understand.

00:13:45.122 --> 00:13:47.933
I'm not upset at all.

00:13:47.933 --> 00:13:50.020
Please don't overthink it.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.833
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:58.122
Nava, I'm not worried.

00:13:58.122 --> 00:14:00.211
I care.

00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:02.155
That's different.

00:14:03.922 --> 00:14:05.722
Thank you.

00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:11.633
I trust you, Nava.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.577
Come on, let's go.

00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:17.977
Okay.

00:14:31.877 --> 00:14:34.000
Ping, where's everyone?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.300
Aunt Son, Mary, Timmy, Lek,
and Maiek are in the back.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.411
As for Phurich and Phana,
they haven't come in yet.

00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:43.233
Sorry, I was held up,

00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:45.122
so I got here late.

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:46.877
Have you been missing me?

00:14:46.877 --> 00:14:49.133
We've only been apart for a little while.

00:14:50.544 --> 00:14:53.822
Excuse me. I'll go check on Aunty Son
and the others at the back.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.820
What's up with him?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.511
I'm not sure,

00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:08.944
but he looked kind of gloomy as well.

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:16.022
- What about Phana?
- He hasn't come in yet.

00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:20.422
What the hell?

00:15:20.422 --> 00:15:23.877
He said he'd come in early,
but he's not answering his phone.

00:15:26.022 --> 00:15:28.222
Can you check on him at his place?

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:30.666
Let me know if you find out anything.

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:33.333
- Got it.
- Thanks.

00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:12.533
Hello? Anyone home?

00:16:15.744 --> 00:16:18.244
Anyone home?

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.880
- What is it?
- Uh...

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.766
Phurich couldn't reach you,

00:16:32.766 --> 00:16:35.222
so he asked me to check on you.

00:16:35.222 --> 00:16:38.444
Yeah, sorry.

00:16:38.444 --> 00:16:40.688
I must've turned my phone off.

00:16:50.266 --> 00:16:52.433
Excuse me.

00:16:58.677 --> 00:17:01.366
You're burning up.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.055
It's fine.

00:17:05.055 --> 00:17:07.466
I'll be fine after some rest.

00:17:07.466 --> 00:17:10.611
Have you taken any medicine yet?

00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:12.655
No.

00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:15.580
I'll call Phurich to let him know
you're not feeling well.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.590
Please go take a rest in your room.

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.570
I'll go get some food and medicine for you.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.322
It's fine.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.866
Yes, Phurich.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.188
Phana's at home, and he has a fever.

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.288
And no one's home.

00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:42.666
Yes, alright, sir.

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:50.180
He told me to take care of you here.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.390
Call him back and tell him I'm fine on my own.

00:17:55.144 --> 00:17:57.200
Don't be stubborn.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.877
Come on, let's get inside.

00:18:16.088 --> 00:18:19.140
The strawberries are here, Mr. Phurich.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.940
Delivered straight to you
with heartfelt service.

00:18:39.611 --> 00:18:40.970
So delicious!

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.750
See?

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.380
With service this good, do you want me to give you a raise?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.550
I hadn't thought about it,
but since you brought it up,

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.533
I'd be happy to accept.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.940
If it's not enough, just let me know.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.988
Aunty Son still has plenty.

00:18:59.988 --> 00:19:02.622
- Thanks.
- No problem.

00:19:02.622 --> 00:19:03.855
Phu!

00:19:03.855 --> 00:19:05.077
Hey!

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.944
You actually made it here.

00:19:06.944 --> 00:19:09.077
I thought you wouldn't be here.

00:19:09.077 --> 00:19:11.988
And if I weren't here, where else would I be?

00:19:11.988 --> 00:19:15.222
Back in Bangkok, when you're not working,

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:20.630
you hang out with a high-society girl and could end up hurting her.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.133
-
- Oh my!

00:19:23.133 --> 00:19:27.977
Yu saying stuff like that ruins my reputation.

00:19:30.566 --> 00:19:33.077
Alright, everyone, these are my brothers.

00:19:33.077 --> 00:19:34.100
Hello.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.855
This is Phuthan, and this is Winyu.

00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:39.688
- Hello.
- This is Mary and Lek.

00:19:39.688 --> 00:19:41.911
- Hello.
- They work here.

00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:43.211
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:19:43.211 --> 00:19:44.911
Hello.

00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:48.090
And that's Nava,

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.377
our bartender.

00:19:51.288 --> 00:19:54.177
Feel free to order whatever you want to drink.

00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:57.590
Are they both your real brothers?

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.344
Yes,

00:19:59.344 --> 00:20:01.244
Phuthan's my biological brother.

00:20:01.244 --> 00:20:05.688
My dad adopted Yu when he was young.

00:20:05.688 --> 00:20:09.210
But honestly, I love Yu
even more than my own brother.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.188
Wow, seriously, Phu?

00:20:12.188 --> 00:20:14.160
- Wow!
- Oh god, don't fight, guys.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.250
Excuse me, I have to say this.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.230
Your younger brothers
are both really good-looking.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.410
Is anyone still single?

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:29.200
Well. My bed's empty,
and I'd love someone to cuddle with.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.660
Sorry, but that won't happen.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.470
These two are seeing each other.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.750
Oh my!

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.933
Hey! You're ridiculous!

00:20:38.933 --> 00:20:42.211
Aww, don't be shy!

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.340
You're perfect for each other.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.460
I'm not even competing, and I lost before I even started!

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.188
Poor me.

00:20:50.188 --> 00:20:53.544
Well, enjoy yourselves.

00:20:54.455 --> 00:20:56.822
Let me know when you break up.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.977
- Wait for me, loser!
- Come!

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.850
So, where's Phana?

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.840
He's not coming today. He's sick.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.633
No way, the boss is sick.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.322
Hey, Phu, show me around. It's beautiful here.

00:21:23.322 --> 00:21:25.000
Sure.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.620
Yu,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.400
are you coming too?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.144
No, I'm fine. You two go ahead.
I'll get a drink.

00:21:34.977 --> 00:21:36.744
Let's go.

00:21:36.744 --> 00:21:38.360
Okay.

00:21:38.944 --> 00:21:40.722
You can eat it.

00:21:40.722 --> 00:21:41.766
Be right back.
- Come on.

00:21:41.766 --> 00:21:43.266
- See you.
- Let's go.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.610
From what I've heard about Nava,

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.755
you've really got it bad, huh?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.822
What happened to the playboy I know? Hmm?

00:22:05.922 --> 00:22:07.188
I don't know.

00:22:07.188 --> 00:22:10.044
The more I get to know him,

00:22:10.044 --> 00:22:13.600
the more I want to be serious with him.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.160
Don't tell me

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.640
you're going to ask him out?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.988
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

00:22:23.988 --> 00:22:26.080
I'm serious.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.440
And I'll do it.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.755
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.077
But from what I saw earlier,

00:22:34.077 --> 00:22:36.655
Nava is really cute.

00:22:36.655 --> 00:22:38.477
Just ask him out already.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.188
So, how's it going

00:22:45.188 --> 00:22:46.855
between you and Yu?

00:22:46.855 --> 00:22:49.033
As far as I can tell,

00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:51.270
there's been no progress.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.655
I've tried to find the right moment
to talk to him several times,

00:22:54.655 --> 00:22:57.244
but he keeps avoiding me.

00:22:57.766 --> 00:23:01.077
I brought him to the island

00:23:01.077 --> 00:23:03.877
hoping we'd get some time to talk.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.680
No wonder Yu thinks that way,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.455
he really respects our dad.

00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:17.520
If he thought about taking things
further with you,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.255
he'd feel like

00:23:19.255 --> 00:23:22.122
he'd feel like he was wronging a benefactor.

00:23:22.122 --> 00:23:24.966
But I'm my own person, aren't I?

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:27.520
Whether Yu likes me or not,

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.290
it's got nothing to do with our dad.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.166
You got this, Than.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.066
You should take your own advice, too.

00:23:44.744 --> 00:23:46.544
You got this.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.166
Go for it.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.990
Do you need anything, Phana?

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.360
Uh... Can I...

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:39.830
Nothing.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.933
There was a mosquito on your head.
I just brushed it away.

00:24:44.922 --> 00:24:46.522
Thank you.

00:24:46.522 --> 00:24:49.030
How are you feeling?

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.177
Has your fever gone down?

00:24:53.588 --> 00:24:55.655
I'm getting better.

00:24:56.944 --> 00:24:58.880
What about you?

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.555
You've been here watching over me since noon.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.390
I'm fine.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.340
I don't like leaving sick people alone.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.611
Let me keep you company tonight.

00:25:15.455 --> 00:25:17.560
You're stubborn.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.622
Fine, I won't stop you.

00:25:19.622 --> 00:25:21.744
There.

00:25:21.744 --> 00:25:23.720
The quilt and pillow are in the closet.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.410
You can use them so your back doesn't hurt.

00:25:31.755 --> 00:25:32.910
Well?

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.188
Or do you want to sleep on the bed with me?

00:25:35.188 --> 00:25:36.655
Huh?

00:25:36.655 --> 00:25:38.340
Nothing.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.711
I was just babbling.

00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:44.188
Go sleep on the floor.

00:25:44.188 --> 00:25:46.733
I don't want you to catch my fever.

00:26:07.455 --> 00:26:10.944
Wow, Daniel, your Thai is so good.

00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:13.350
I'm impressed.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.440
I've studied Thai for years,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.100
but I like to mess with people for fun.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.340
Can you speak any other languages?

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.433
Just Thai and English.

00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:27.610
I have a thing for Thai people,

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.580
especially cute ones like you.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.270
Even if you praise me like that,

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.955
don't expect a free refill.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.033
There's no such thing as a freebie, right?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.600
Hold on.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.720
I paid a lot for these drinks,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.211
I deserve something extra.

00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:06.970
Excuse me, sir.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.622
The drinks you got don't come with any promotions.

00:27:13.988 --> 00:27:16.210
Then just tell me,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.911
how much?

00:27:21.188 --> 00:27:23.300
What number?

00:27:25.011 --> 00:27:27.340
What an innocent answer.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.866
Well.

00:27:28.866 --> 00:27:31.620
What if I wanted you to stay with me tonight,

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.811
how much would you charge?

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:37.255
I think you've got the wrong idea.

00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:39.680
Nothing's wrong.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.230
Everything's got a price.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.788
You do, too.

00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:47.355
Just tell me

00:27:47.355 --> 00:27:49.344
and I'll pay.

00:27:51.855 --> 00:27:54.522
You think you can buy me with money?

00:27:54.522 --> 00:27:57.344
I think you've misunderstood something.

00:28:00.866 --> 00:28:02.655
Not at all.

00:28:02.655 --> 00:28:04.477
With all due respect,

00:28:04.477 --> 00:28:07.310
you wouldn't be doing this job
if money didn't matter.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.880
And besides,

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.888
I believe you wouldn't be foolish enough
to turn down my offer.

00:28:14.922 --> 00:28:17.900
You're the foolish one.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.150
Who do you think you are?

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.833
How dare you call me foolish?

00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:25.230
Do you know who I am?

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.460
Don't mess with him.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.950
Who the fuck are you?

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.160
If you don't shut up, I'll kill you.

00:28:36.922 --> 00:28:38.580
Try me then.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.011
Get out of my bar.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.850
Nava,

00:28:56.577 --> 00:28:58.830
are you alright?

00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:10.600
Here, some hot coffee.

00:29:18.433 --> 00:29:22.055
Do you want anything else? I'll get it for you.

00:29:24.455 --> 00:29:26.522
No, it's fine.

00:29:26.522 --> 00:29:29.788
Don't worry. I'm okay.

00:29:29.788 --> 00:29:33.655
How could I not worry, hm?

00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:35.620
I deal with customers like this all the time.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.777
I'm used to it.

00:29:38.655 --> 00:29:41.211
If you run into customers like this again,

00:29:41.211 --> 00:29:43.988
stay away from them, okay?

00:29:45.522 --> 00:29:47.733
Roger that.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.555
But you should head back now, it's late.

00:29:58.333 --> 00:30:00.477
Are you kicking me out?

00:30:00.477 --> 00:30:02.355
No,

00:30:02.355 --> 00:30:06.211
I don't want you driving home so late.

00:30:06.211 --> 00:30:09.200
I've got something
I'd like to talk to you about.

00:30:10.611 --> 00:30:12.355
What is it?

00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:16.455
After what happened today,

00:30:16.455 --> 00:30:20.844
I realized that
I really want to take care of you.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.340
Please be my boyfriend.

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:53.766
Okay.

00:30:53.766 --> 00:30:56.611
Maybe I'm rushing you.

00:30:56.611 --> 00:30:59.088
You probably need some time.

00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:04.211
Phurich,

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.970
I think...

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.622
it's best if we end things here.

00:31:13.166 --> 00:31:16.677
- I don't want you to wait or get your hopes--
- Say no more.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.011
Actually, it's been a rough day for you.

00:31:23.822 --> 00:31:26.155
You should rest.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.866
I'll get going.

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:43.188
Alright.

00:32:10.766 --> 00:32:16.622
Never forget what humans did to us 20 years ago.

00:32:19.566 --> 00:32:21.877
After what happened today,

00:32:21.877 --> 00:32:26.266
I realized that
I really want to take care of you.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.320
Please be my boyfriend.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.980
I already told Nava that no human ever truly loves us.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.190
Humans just see us as monsters

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.820
or demons.

00:32:39.822 --> 00:32:42.255
There's a big difference between us and humans.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.444
You know, humans and merfolk...

00:32:46.444 --> 00:32:49.920
we're not so different from each other.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.155
We all have feelings, and we all have hearts.

00:32:54.155 --> 00:32:56.530
If our hearts can connect with one another,

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.033
then even a love that seems impossible

00:33:00.033 --> 00:33:02.380
can become possible.

00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:06.155
I'm really confused, Mom.

00:33:27.144 --> 00:33:30.377
Phu, which move should I make next?

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.400
Come on, help me out.

00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:41.211
Please.

00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:43.522
A bit, yeah?

00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:47.088
Make that move, and I'll take your piece.

00:33:48.366 --> 00:33:50.722
What's up with you? Where did your focus go?

00:33:50.722 --> 00:33:52.700
Than, think for yourself.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.000
You keep asking for Phu's help.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.210
Serves you right.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.777
I was sick for a second,

00:33:57.777 --> 00:33:59.666
and you already asked him to be your boyfriend.

00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:02.066
I've warned you many times.

00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:05.388
Nava's really playing hard to get.

00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:09.100
Phu's been after him all week,

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.977
but he's not budging at all.

00:34:12.977 --> 00:34:16.233
Phu, I think you should give up.

00:34:16.233 --> 00:34:20.488
If you really want to date someone, go find someone else.

00:34:22.055 --> 00:34:24.677
You just got dumped yourself.

00:34:24.677 --> 00:34:27.190
You're not in a position to give advice.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.877
Oof, a counter.

00:34:30.877 --> 00:34:33.944
- That shut the boss right up!
- You little brat.

00:34:42.755 --> 00:34:44.611
Nava,

00:34:44.611 --> 00:34:47.511
I heard you told Ping you were craving a cake
from your favorite shop.

00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:50.255
I was in town this morning,
so I bought one for you.

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.611
It's in the fridge.

00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:54.122
Thank you,

00:34:54.122 --> 00:34:56.922
but you don't have to do that next time.

00:34:56.922 --> 00:34:58.588
Phana,

00:34:58.588 --> 00:35:02.455
I'll check the stock in the back
and bring you the updated list.

00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:04.511
Call me if you need anything.

00:35:09.722 --> 00:35:12.800
Look at you, all glum.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.080
Come sit here.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.310
- Hey, go on.
- I can walk myself.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.811
Let go.

00:35:20.633 --> 00:35:23.533
Wait, hey,

00:35:23.533 --> 00:35:25.777
where's my piece?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.144
I captured it earlier,
just before you stood up.

00:35:36.744 --> 00:35:38.466
Nava.

00:35:40.455 --> 00:35:42.722
Is something wrong?

00:35:43.366 --> 00:35:45.544
Why did you do this?

00:35:45.544 --> 00:35:47.477
Do?

00:35:47.477 --> 00:35:49.290
What did I do?

00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:53.333
You've been avoiding me all week.

00:35:53.333 --> 00:35:55.611
Acting all cold.

00:35:55.611 --> 00:35:58.166
You're treating me like I'm nothing.

00:35:59.155 --> 00:36:02.400
You didn't come to talk to me about work.

00:36:03.766 --> 00:36:05.677
So what is this about?

00:36:08.322 --> 00:36:10.966
I think I've made myself clear.

00:36:10.966 --> 00:36:13.711
I think it's best we end things here.

00:36:16.088 --> 00:36:18.450
Let me ask you something.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.870
Do you really want things between us
to end like this?

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.800
If what you're about to say isn't true,

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.420
then don't say it.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.344
I already know how you really feel,

00:36:34.344 --> 00:36:37.377
and I'm not giving up that easily.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.588
Uh, Phurich?

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.070
Phana said I should tell you

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.060
he's taking Phuthan
to a friend's party tonight,

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.260
and you're coming too.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.370
Tell him I'm not going.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.011
I'm staying to watch the bar.

00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:02.840
Then you'll have to tell him yourself.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.410
He said you must come.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:23.511
By the way, you and Phurich
aren't having any problems, right?

00:37:29.988 --> 00:37:31.500
Forget it.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.200
It's nothing.

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:52.200
Oh, Nava, I thought you had already gone home.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.830
I just needed to clear up a bit of work.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.344
Has everyone else already gone?

00:37:55.344 --> 00:37:56.855
Yeah.

00:37:56.855 --> 00:37:58.211
Get home safe.

00:37:58.211 --> 00:38:00.711
You too. Take care.

00:38:13.344 --> 00:38:16.033
Hello there, darling.

00:38:16.033 --> 00:38:18.380
Remember me?

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.744
Daniel!

00:38:19.744 --> 00:38:21.711
What are you doing?

00:38:24.888 --> 00:38:26.588
- Come here!
- No!

00:38:26.588 --> 00:38:29.255
Let go! Don't!

00:38:30.277 --> 00:38:31.877
No!

00:38:37.766 --> 00:38:39.680
First,

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.490
I'm just getting payback
for what you did to me.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.177
And second,

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.720
when I want something, I get it.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.990
It's that simple.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:53.311
That's just how it works.

00:39:07.266 --> 00:39:09.340
Hey!

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.050
- Who the hell?
- What the hell are you doing?

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.922
Oh, wow!

00:39:14.922 --> 00:39:16.955
Hey, pretty boy.

00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:19.144
We meet again.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.222
Damn it. Useless idiot!

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.750
I told you, didn't I?

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.844
Stay the hell away from Nava.

00:39:37.844 --> 00:39:39.444
So what?

00:39:40.533 --> 00:39:42.470
Do something about it.

00:40:15.255 --> 00:40:17.633
Easy, man.

00:40:18.911 --> 00:40:21.211
Let's talk this out calmly.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.944
Hey!

00:40:28.944 --> 00:40:31.350
Next time, I won't miss.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.311
You don't have to tell me.

00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:35.630
Okay, fine.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.655
Okay.

00:40:39.011 --> 00:40:40.440
Hey!

00:40:41.288 --> 00:40:42.860
Hey!

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.588
Damn it. I kicked him too hard.

00:40:44.588 --> 00:40:47.710
Hey, let's go!

00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:55.533
This isn't over!

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.877
Nava.

00:41:10.877 --> 00:41:13.177
Nava!

00:41:13.177 --> 00:41:15.022
Nava, can you hear me?

00:41:15.022 --> 00:41:16.722
Nava!

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.188
Nava!

00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:48.833
Phurich.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.000
Careful.

00:41:58.811 --> 00:42:00.611
Alright.

00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:12.888
Are you okay?

00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:16.955
I'm fine.

00:42:20.677 --> 00:42:23.144
Why am I here?

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.000
You don't remember anything?

00:42:30.622 --> 00:42:35.711
I remember Daniel trying to take me away.

00:42:35.711 --> 00:42:38.766
And my head hit the ground.

00:42:40.822 --> 00:42:44.688
Then I heard your voice.

00:42:44.688 --> 00:42:50.522
Luckily, I went back to the bar to get my stuff, and I ran into you.

00:42:53.455 --> 00:42:56.188
You saved me?

00:43:02.822 --> 00:43:04.588
Thank you.

00:43:17.233 --> 00:43:19.022
Don't mention it.

00:43:19.022 --> 00:43:21.766
I'm just glad you're safe.

00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:24.644
I was going to take you home,

00:43:24.644 --> 00:43:29.866
but I was afraid they might follow, so I brought you to my place first.

00:43:32.444 --> 00:43:36.022
I just cleaned up your wounds a bit.

00:43:36.944 --> 00:43:39.150
What about them?

00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:42.366
I already called the police.

00:43:42.366 --> 00:43:45.500
They'll catch those guys soon.

00:43:48.277 --> 00:43:51.033
Don't worry too much.

00:43:51.033 --> 00:43:53.270
Take it easy.

00:43:57.744 --> 00:44:00.533
You're not hurt, right?

00:44:04.522 --> 00:44:07.388
Do you want to take a shower?

00:44:07.388 --> 00:44:11.366
If you can't manage, I can help you wash up.

00:44:11.366 --> 00:44:14.411
It's alright, I can do it myself.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:20.088
I'll go get you a towel.

00:44:30.944 --> 00:44:33.655
Didn't you just say you were fine?

00:44:38.144 --> 00:44:40.044
Just a scratch.

00:44:41.922 --> 00:44:44.266
Let me clean it for you.

00:45:00.055 --> 00:45:02.077
Does it hurt much?

00:45:03.188 --> 00:45:05.088
Not really.

00:45:11.633 --> 00:45:14.233
Not really, huh?

00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:15.733
Are you teasing me?

00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:17.633
Done.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.222
Is something wrong?

00:45:37.377 --> 00:45:41.477
Do you know how scared I was?

00:45:42.155 --> 00:45:44.755
I thought I was going to lose you.

00:45:48.144 --> 00:45:51.277
I'm safe because you saved me.

00:46:03.144 --> 00:46:06.677
I know I've already asked you before.

00:46:06.677 --> 00:46:09.500
But let me ask again.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.388
Let me be the one to take care of you, Nava.

00:46:16.077 --> 00:46:19.333
I don't know what you're afraid of

00:46:21.188 --> 00:46:24.344
or what you're hiding,

00:46:27.033 --> 00:46:31.890
but every time I see you, I just want to be by your side.

00:46:36.366 --> 00:46:38.566
You don't have to be perfect.

00:46:38.566 --> 00:46:41.500
Just be yourself.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.933
That's all it takes for me to love you.

00:46:56.544 --> 00:46:58.000
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.790

Phana, what's up with you and Ping?
[Next Episode]

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.477
You seem way too interested in him.

00:47:42.477 --> 00:47:43.944
I don't even know, man.

00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:45.460
Honestly, I'm confused myself.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.250
What do you think I should do?

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.400
Than, we grew up together.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.322
Do you really think
Dad would ever accept this if he knew?

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.460
You got a tattoo?

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.790
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:08.870
From now on, if anything happens to you, tell me right away, okay?

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:11.800
I just saw another merman swimming that way.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.000
Shall we follow and see?
I want to know who it is.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.860
Is there anything you want to tell me?

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.120
I was afraid they were with the merman hunters.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.820
So I handled them.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.833
Stand down.

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:45.240
♫ The sky that seems so far away ♫

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:50.240
♫ And the sea that seems so vast ♫

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.660
♫ I just watch the waves all day
Knowing we can never meet ♫

00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:00.500

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:05.060
