[Lover Merman — Only Nava]
♫ We don't have to tell anyone ♫

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.870
What business do you have with Nava
so early in the morning? [Previously]

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.540
What about you?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.150
Why are you here so early?

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.060
It's a personal matter.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.040
An outsider like you... doesn't need to know.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.420
Since when do you know so much
about my private life, Than?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.830
Yu, did Than trick you into coming here?

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.970
I've never tricked anyone in my life.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.910
Excuse me, Phana.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.100
Whoa! You're burning up.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.900
Let me stay and take care of you tonight.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.910
If I wanted you to spend the night with me,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.800
what's your price?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.960
I don't think you'd be foolish enough
to refuse my offer.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.340
You're the foolish one.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.960
When I want something, I get it.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.770
Hey!

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.850
Who the hell?

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.160
I told you, didn't I?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.130
Stay the hell away from Nava.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.550
I know I've already asked before.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.690
But let me ask again.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.910
Let me be the one to take care of you, always.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.200
You don't have to be perfect.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.850
Just be yourself.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.290
That's all it takes for me to love you.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.790
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.780

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.170
♫ Because none of that matters at all ♫

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.790
My head is spinning.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.760
Phana's friends are crazy.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.000
We should have left a long time ago.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.870
You're the one who wanted to stay longer.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.960
Can I lean on you for a bit?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.760
Why don't you go lie down on the bed?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.710
I'd rather be here.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.630
If I knew you were this cute when drunk,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.420
I'd want you to drink more often.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.110
Who's drunk? I'm not drunk at all.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.910
Your face is all red,
but you're still denying it.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.920
You're drunk.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.720
Wait.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.620
What's wrong, Yu?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.160
Let's not do this, okay?

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.360
We've come this far... What's the matter?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.560
I'm just drunk, alright?
I didn't mean for this.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.010
You didn't mean it?

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.880
You've known all along
how I feel about you, haven't you?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.632
Yes, I know.

00:08:16.632 --> 00:08:18.860
But it's impossible.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.400
We grew up together, Than.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.250
If Dad finds out about this,
do you think he'd accept it?

00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:31.790
Please don't make me feel even guiltier
towards Dad than I already do.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.800
Who cares about Dad?

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.860
Whatever we feel for each other
has nothing to do with him!

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.320
We're not kids anymore, Than.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.950
You can't just get everything you want.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.220
In the adult world, things aren't always that simple.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.890
That has nothing to do with it.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.420
Just because you think this is wrong, you're not even going to try?

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.690
With us, and with Dad...

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.480
You've just decided everything on your own.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.340
Aren't you doing the same thing?

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.440
Deciding that it "can" work...

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.520
You've made up your mind all by yourself, too.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.930
I'm getting another room tonight.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.230
As for us let's talk about it later.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.550
We're both too emotional right now.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500
Hey, Yu, wait!

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.470
Wow, that smells amazing.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.660
You're awake?

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.210
I was just about to wake you.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.063
The smell of your coffee
and breakfast...

00:10:48.063 --> 00:10:50.670
woke me up.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.090
It's just something simple, but I guarantee

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.666
it's as delicious as the porridge
you made for me.

00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:01.420
Shouldn't I be the judge of that?

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.411
Before you judge...

00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:11.650
can I get my reward first?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.510
Did you sleep well last night?

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.070
Very well.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.693
In that case...

00:11:31.693 --> 00:11:34.026
you should sleep over more often.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.720
Is it good?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.780
It's delicious.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.260
Fragrant,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.900
sweet...

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.160
Just how I like it.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.070
And what about my kiss?

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.070
Which one is sweeter?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.973
Phurich.

00:12:14.973 --> 00:12:17.000
You're going to make me choke.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.300
Okay, okay. I'll stop teasing.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.990
You don't have to go into the bar today.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.180
I think you need some rest.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.190
Alright.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.350
When you're finished,

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.590
I'll drive you home.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.400
What are you looking at?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.160
I'm waiting for an answer.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.260
My kiss, or the coffee...

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.400
which one is sweeter?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.850
The coffee, obviously.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.740
Then I'd better kiss you again.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.200
♫ In love ♫

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.610

♫ As long as we love each other ♫

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.180
If I had been there last night,

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.260
that damn foreigner
wouldn't have gotten off so easily.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.500
Even if you had been,
you were too drunk to help.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.710
Thank you so much for saving my brother.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.500
Consider me in your debt as well.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.080
It's fine.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.150
I have too many debtors already.
Collecting is tiring.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.330
Good thing your dad made you learn Taekwondo,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.430
Judo, and Muay Thai as a kid, huh?

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.250
It really paid off.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.320
By the way, when you were fighting,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.650
did you shout out move names,
like "Tiger Claw Fist"?

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.170
Seriously, how old are you?

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.090
Um... excuse me.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.500
Yeah, Ping?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.070
Can I leave early today?

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.440
What's up?

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.450
Some friends from the mainland
are visiting the island.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.030
They're arriving on the last boat,
so I wanted to go meet them.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.960
Are they really just friends?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.000
Yes, friends from my faculty.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.080
A whole group of them.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.930
What time are you leaving? Do you need a ride?

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.830
I was planning to leave
about an hour before closing.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.820
But I can get there myself.
You don't need to trouble yourself, sir.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.250
Do you think they're really just friends?

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.940
- Phana.
- What?

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.620
What's going on between you and Ping?

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.720
You seem weirdly interested in him.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.540
No, I'm not.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.320
I'm just looking out for my staff, that's all.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.100
Ping isn't from here.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.540
If he's going out somewhere,
shouldn't I check up on him?

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.880
Man, I'm starving. I'm going to ask Aunt Son
to make me something.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.730
Hey, Phana.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.020
I don't buy it.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.680
Hello? What's up, Than?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.520
Where is he now?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.200
Phurich told me the police are looking for him,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.100
but they haven't found him yet.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.110
This isn't just some joke anymore, Nava.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.090
Excuse me, I need to make a call.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.080
I'm sorry for making you worry about me, Phraphai.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.407
Nava, you didn't do anything wrong.

00:16:54.407 --> 00:16:56.600
You don't need to apologize.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.083
Because from now on,
if anything else happens to you,

00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:02.070
you have to tell me right away.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.770
Understand?

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.410
Yes.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.130
Nava, are you hurt anywhere?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.360
Not anymore.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.070
If it were possible,
I'd want you by my side always.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:32.020
I want to be there to protect you,
to take care of you.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.220
Let me be the one to take care of you, always.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.270
I understand

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.760
how you feel.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.260
If something bad ever happened
to my own dear brother,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.020
I'd probably feel the same way.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.140
"Your dear brother."

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.090
Okay then, let me go reheat your food.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.420
It's gotten cold.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.780
Okay.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.720
Phurich! You scared me.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.950
That's because I missed you.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.540
But we just saw each other yesterday morning,

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.460
and we talked on the phone last night.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.430
Isn't it a bit too soon to miss me?

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.950
I just want to be with you all the time.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.660
You're exaggerating. How could you do that?

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.120
I can if you want me to,

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.400
boyfriend.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.290
You're impossible.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.950
Why? Feeling feisty?

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.670
You know, when you act like this,
it makes me fall for you even harder.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.720
I never said you couldn't.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.390
Uh... Sorry to interrupt.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.890
Maybe I should come back later.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.290
Wait, Yu.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.410
Did you need something? You're here early.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.410
Go on ahead to the bar first, okay?

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.910
Okay.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.020
I wanted to consult with you about something.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.160
Than called me last night.
He told me everything about you two.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.550
I've been thinking about this for a while.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:30.040
I've decided I'm going to resign
from the company.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.540
If I quit, I won't have to see Than anymore.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.910
If that's really what you've decided,

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.680
then I respect your decision.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.660
But I still want you to think it over
one more time.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.950
If I really go through with this,
will you be angry with me, Phu?

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.400
The three of us grew up together.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.520
You're like a brother to me.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.600
Of course, I wouldn't be angry
over something like this.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.240
I just want you to be happy
with whatever you choose.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.380
I understand both of you.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.070
Than's feelings for you,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.980
and your perspective on the situation.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.220
Love is complicated like that.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.980
If it were just you
and the person you love in the world,

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.680
feelings would always win out
over logic, right?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.760
Speaking of which,
it seems like in your world with Nava,

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.140
there are only the two of you left now, huh?

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.480
You've been led entirely
by your feelings since this morning.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.580
You've gotten much better at teasing.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.610
Did you pick that up from Than?

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.510
I guess so.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.790
Just think carefully before you decide.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.290
I will.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.530
Mary has been practicing her baking lately,

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.520
and she wanted you to try her dessert.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.700
- Have you tried it yet?
- Oh, not yet.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.900
But I can try it later in the back
with everyone else.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.330
No need. Go ahead and try it now.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.830
Okay.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.730
Hey, this isn't bad at all.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.410
Come on, faster. My arm's getting tired.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.280
It really is delicious, Phana.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.040
You got something on your face.
I wiped it off for you.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.950
Oh, thank you.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.260
You eat like a messy little kid.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.600
Oh, and from now on, stop calling me "Mr. Phana."

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.370
It feels too formal.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.720
Just call me Phana, like everyone else.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.170
Okay...

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.870
Phana.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.520
What are you thinking about?

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.900
I wanted to apologize...

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.190
about quitting the company.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.540
You know, Yu,

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.150
I hate you so much right now.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.920
But no matter how much I hate you,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.220
it still doesn't change how I feel about you.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.260
Than, you know...

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.750
I'm just as sad about this as you are.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.660
The more I talk about it, the worse it feels...

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.110
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.010
Yeah, you are really selfish.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.230
Well, since we're here,

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.360
you can yell at me
or say whatever you want today.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.040
I'm ready for it.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:51.392
No,

00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:53.272
I'm tired.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.860
And if you want to be selfish, then go ahead.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.230
Everyone is selfish in their own way.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.030
There's nothing strange about it.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.520
And from now on,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.170
I'm going to be selfish, too.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.130
Maybe even more selfish than you.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.510
Because what I'm going to do...

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.780
is keep loving you.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.120
Even if you quit the company
and move somewhere else,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.900
I'll still love you.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.260
I'll keep pursuing you
until you finally give in.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.440
I'll keep telling you I love you,

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.800
whether you accept it or not.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.070
I'll stay right here. I won't go anywhere.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.430
Because I don't know...

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.180
if I could ever love anyone else

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.740
if it's not you.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.750
Than, you know what? You're not just selfish,

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.170
you're also manipulative
and incredibly stubborn.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.490
Are you still not used to that?

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.100
I honestly can't guess

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.730
how things between Winyu and Phuthan
will turn out.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:38.050
Once other factors come into play,

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.020
love is no longer just about two people.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:46.600
And what if... there are other factors

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.510
involved for us, too?

00:27:50.037 --> 00:27:52.837
When that day comes,
will you follow your heart or your head?

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.720
Whether it's my head or my heart,

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.250
whichever one

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.590
allows me to be with you...

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.060
that's the one I'll choose.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.050
Even if it's the wrong choice?

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.890
Yes. No matter what, I'll choose you.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.340
By the way,

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.220
just don't do what you did
at the bar again, okay?

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.690
Good thing it was only Winyu here today.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.280
But you were the one who started it.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.750
Doesn't matter.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.470
From now on, you can't act like anything
more than my boss around others.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.300
Why not?

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.070
Why don't you want other people to know?

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.650
Everyone's going to find out
eventually anyway, right?

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.890
I'm just not ready yet.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.460
Please give me a little more time.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.100
Alright.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.250
Whatever you need, Nava.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.560
But when it's just the two of us...

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.370
you can't stop me.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.620
Phurich, that's enough.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.440
Phurich!

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.700
[Full & a Half Kohkhen]

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.470
Text me when you arrive, okay?

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.390
And you, Phu. Go visit Dad sometime.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:27.300
Don't come crying to me if he actually leaves
the whole inheritance to me.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.710
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.780
You two should come visit again soon.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.580
- We will.
- Okay.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.630
Take good care of Phu for me, Nava.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.740
Alright, hurry up and go.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.700
- Lek.
- Yes, sir?

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.720
- Can you take these two back?
- Sure.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.370
No point hanging around here.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.190
The car's ready, sirs. Mr. Phuthan, Mr. Winyu.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.680
This way, please.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.390
Let's go.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.050
See you later.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.080
Bye, Phu.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.480
Let's go.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.440
By the way...

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.330
Why did Winyu ask you to look after Nava?

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.640
Yeah, good question.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.570
Don't tell me Nava and Phurich are...

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.730
Excuse me. I need to check
the inventory in the back.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.180
Right then.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.330
You and I need to go into town today
to buy decorations for the bar.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.060
- Let's go now.
- What...?

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.070
I'm getting hungry.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.250
What's gotten into you?
Just leave whenever you feel like it.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.020
Is there something you want to tell me?

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.290
Yes. The night before last,
someone tried to kidnap Nava.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:07.160
I was worried they might come back
for him again.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.730
And besides that, I was concerned

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.750
they might be part of that group
hunting merfolk.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.030
So I dealt with them.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.300
I won't judge you for handling it that way.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.070
But you should have told me first.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.420
You are the son of the island chief.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.490
You need to be more careful about your actions.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.600
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.550
Yes, Father.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.930
One more thing.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:44.490
I know you've been investigating
the concession rights and the mermaid hunters.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.430
Drop it.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.290
Why?

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.950
I will handle this myself.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.530
You're getting involved
when you don't fully understand the situation

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.070
will only cause problems for me.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.990
Understood.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.190
Then... I'll be leaving now.

Did you get a tattoo?

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.530
It's just a temporary tattoo sticker.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.590
I thought it looked nice,
so I wanted to try it.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.210
Oh? Are we stopping?

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.320
Sorry.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.880
I'm just a little tired today.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.190
You didn't seem tired a minute ago.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.960
I promise,

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.650
tomorrow I'll do anything you want.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.240
Alright then.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:17.610
Whatever you say.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.280
Today's going to be tough.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.530
Ping took off, and Nava isn't here either.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.970
I don't understand your mom.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.320
Why did she have to take Nava out for errands
today of all days?

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.330
How should I know what my mom is thinking?

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.020
Why are you so upset about it?

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.690
I'm not. It's just that since I moved here,

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.790
I've never seen Nava work
on a full moon day. Not once.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.940
Are you still fixated on my brother?

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.120
You two have been getting closer lately.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.910
You haven't crossed the line I drew,
have you, Phu?

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.890
Yeah, yeah, I know you're protective of him.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.190
But what about you?

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.010
What's going on with Ping?

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.940
Are you hitting on him?

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.240
Don't just stay silent.
Tell me what's going on.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.730
Since Namhom and I broke up,

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.470
I've actually become closer to Ping.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.550
I feel really comfortable

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.310
when I'm around him.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.220
Damn. So it's true.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.020
So what happens now?

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:45.890
That's what I don't know.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.090
It's not just because you're lonely, right?

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.070
I can't answer that.
I honestly don't know myself.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.910
What do you think I should do?

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.520
If you're not really sure
about your own feelings yet,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.050
then don't lead Ping on like you did before.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.920
I want you to take some time and figure out

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.820
if you actually like him
or if you're just lonely.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.690
It might seem strange for someone like me
to be talking to you about this,

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.310
but like I said,

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.830
I don't want you playing with his feelings.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.720
And furthermore, I don't want you to use Ping
as a replacement for Namhom,

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.520
who you just broke up with.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.360
I just saw another merperson swimming that way.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.450
Did you see it too, Phraphai?

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:06.350
I saw a tail flash.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.320
It definitely wasn't Met.

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:12.160
Should we go take a look?

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.290
I want to know who it is.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:16.740
Usually, it's just us around here.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.820
If we hadn't met in the water,
we never would have known.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.380
I had a feeling the first time I met you, Ping,

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.250
that we had something in common.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.310
And I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.450
Where do you normally shed your toxins?

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.870
Usually a bit further out.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.880
But last time, I was swimming around
before coming ashore

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.050
and happened to find the coral around here.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.910
Do you always come alone when you shed?

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.710
You don't have a group?

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.800
Well, I don't really know anyone.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.040
My mom doesn't really like merfolk.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.470
So I never had the chance to meet anyone.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.620
I'm half-human.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.201
My parents fell in love...

00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:07.720
My mom didn't know my dad was a merman.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.450
She only found out after I was born.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.390
After she found out, she was shocked.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.600
And she ended up hating my father...

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.850
and hating me, too.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.170
Are you still living with your parents?

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.270
My father passed away when I was young.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.960
Now it's just me and my mom.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.440
But I rarely go home.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.440
I mostly stay at my dorm.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.640
It's okay.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.440
At least we found each other.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.890
I'm really glad I met you too, Nava.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:59.690
By the way... what's going on
between you and Phana?

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.140
I can sense...

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.370
how you feel about him.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.530
Come on, tell me the truth. Don't lie.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.140
To be honest...

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.240
I do have feelings for him.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.540
But please don't tell anyone.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.820
Go for it. I'm rooting for you.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:39.240
Here, have something to drink.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.800
Thank you.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:48.590
Ping, I'm sorry, but I couldn't help
overhearing your conversation.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.390
I can't support you having feelings for Phana.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.330
Even though he's a human I trust completely,

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.250
merfolk and humans just can't be together.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.210
Why not?

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.510
There are too many unexpected complications
between humans and merfolk.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.310
If you don't believe me,

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:15.050
just look at your own parents.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:16.930
They couldn't make it work either.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:26.980
Ping,

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.360
I'm telling you this because I care about you.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.650
I don't want to see you get hurt.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:35.930
But a merman and a human
just can't fall in love.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.810
So... should we head back?

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:48.340
Yeah. Let's go.

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.060
I'll give you a ride back.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:55.120
Let's go get changed first.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.370
Are you staying here tonight?

Humans have started hunting merfolk

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.530
Several have already been kidnapped.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:49.040
With everything that's happening,
I don't feel safe anymore.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.450
From now on,

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.290
I'll be personally responsible
for Nava's safety.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.810
I know how frustrating this is for you.

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.610
But I feel the same way.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.940
And yet you still choose to listen to others

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.640
instead of following our feelings?

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.010
You have Phraphai picking Nava up
and dropping him off every day.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.100
What game are you playing?

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.780
Or are you just trying to keep Nava
and me apart?

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.810
I think we need some space for a while.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.330
I feel like we've gotten too close.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:24.100
I don't even know how I really feel
about him anymore.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:28.140
Maybe... maybe I don't really want Ping
after all.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:24.820
♫ Though the rules of this world
Forbid us from being one ♫

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:33.200
♫ This love is about you and me
And no one else ♫

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.990
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're in love ♫

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:41.650
♫ We don't have to tell anyone
and make it messy ♫

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:43.950
♫ Let you be my world ♫

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:48.240
♫ Let's live in our own new world together ♫

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.970
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're together ♫

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:56.610
♫ Because none of that matters at all ♫

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.770
♫ As long as our hearts are one ♫

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:00.630
♫ As long as you are with me ♫

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.980
♫ As long as we love each other ♫

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:07.550
♫ We don't have to tell anyone ♫
