(Did he notice something?)

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.440
I heard Mr. Song

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.320
was assassinated by a killer
that goes by "Red Bean."

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.520
"Red Bean"?

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.600
The red bean
that grows in southern lands?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.760
Your palms are sweating.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.600
Of course, you're gripping me so tightly.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.980
Who are you looking for?

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.240
Good day, Mrs. Song.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.500
I'm Zhou Musheng
from the North City Chamber of Commerce.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.600
This is my friend,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.280
Rose.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.480
I've heard of you.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.600
I knew sooner or later

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.440
someone would come looking for us.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.760
Let's talk in the room.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.160
Please have a seat.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.160
Serve the tea.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.040
Let's not beat around the bush.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.720
I'll be blunt.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.600
Mrs. Song,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.640
the people despise collaborators.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.440
Mr. Song is dead.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.100
Those precious items he had

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.350
would be better off with someone
who knows their value.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.440
Song only collected them as a hobby.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.760
Are you

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.760
a fellow collector?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.770
I don't know much about them,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.600
but my boss is an expert.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.240
Why not bring out a few pieces

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.760
for him to appraise?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.560
That can be arranged.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.040
We only ask

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.920
that he put in a good word for us

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.760
with the higher-ups.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.200
Song

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.520
is dead.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.920
Can these matters

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840
end here?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.040
Leave a chance

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.120
for me and my children to survive.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.600
I don't get to decide
who gets labeled a traitor.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.280
But you came to the right person

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.880
to make a plea.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.080
I can try to speak for you,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.080
depending on your course of action.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.990
It's customary to bring gifts
when meeting for the first time.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.280
Right.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.320
Please feel free to look around.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.320
If anything suits you,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.920
I'll have my people pack it up.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.240
You can take your time
to admire them at your leisure.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.520
We couldn't possibly.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.880
Come, Rose.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.990
Take a look around.
If anything catches your eye,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.000
tell Mrs. Song.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.120
This, this,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.520
and those…

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.040
All of these.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.320
This, that…

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.960
And all of these.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.400
I'll take all of them.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.720
All right.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.760
There are too many eyes during the day.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.960
I'll send someone to deliver them
to your residence tonight.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.480
Our boss has just

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.880
this little hobby.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.160
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.000
It's late.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.240
I won't keep you for dinner.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.040
What's that smell?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.840
Those are the dogs Mr. Song kept.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.600
I found them dirty and smelly,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.040
so I locked them up.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.840
(There's something suspicious here.)

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.640
You two have a safe trip.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.200
Mrs. Song.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.040
I'll report

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.960
what you told me to the boss.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.680
But if today's matter leaks,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.560
you'll be responsible.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.040
It won't.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.920
My lips are sealed.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.560
(Hmph.)

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.760
(Robbing people
while looking so respectable.)

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.960
(How hypocritical.)

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.720
Let's go.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.320
That traitor hoarded

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.920
many treasures.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.520
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.240
This one looks nice.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.720
Consider it my appearance fee.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.520
Money grubber.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.360
I'm a popular singer.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.440
I charge well.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.460
Can you fit all of that in your purse?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.120
I'll be off, then.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.320
Let me know if anything like this

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.440
comes up again.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.850
You're leaving just like that?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.320
What?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.520
Are you inviting me to stay the night?

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.300
Did the Song Residence

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.360
bring up any memories?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.880
Not really.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.280
But that treasure room

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.880
does seem familiar.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.040
Probably because these treasures
all seem so dear to me.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.040
If there's nothing else,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.960
I'm going to bed.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.240
Any luck

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.680
finding the students?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.990
There's a traitor among the students.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.840
The mole sold

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.160
the students' information to Song.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.280
To curry favor with the Japanese,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.800
he kidnapped a bunch of them.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.760
Much time has passed,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.180
and I still haven't found
where the students ended up.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.760
What's that smell?

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.840
Those are the dogs Mr. Song kept.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.720
I found them dirty and smelly,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.960
so I locked them up.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.280
(That room.)

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.920
(The students.)

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.520
Extra, extra!

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.680
Read all about it!

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.560
This is what I found
at Mr. Song's residence.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.840
These are all just names.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.520
And a key.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.800
(There's definitely more to that room.)

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.840
(That key)

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.920
(might be the key to that room.)

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.320
What do you want the key for?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520
I might know

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.320
what it's used for.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.200
I'll test my theory tonight.
