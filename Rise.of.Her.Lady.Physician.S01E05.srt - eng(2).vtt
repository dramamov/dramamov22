=Not a Troublemaker, but Never a Coward!=

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.160
When did we

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.560
recruit a female officer?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.480
Tell me,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
who are you?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.000
Why did you disguise yourself

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.160
and sneak into the Men's Bathhouse?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.160
I...

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.120
I'm exhausted.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.200
Need to take a good bath.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.240
Yes.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.400
Hide inside.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.160
You must be new
to the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.230
I haven't seen you before.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.100
That's right.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.720
Have you had dinner?

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.840
Of course.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.880
It's already past

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.000
dinner time.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.480
Brother,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.920
why are you taking a bath
with your clothes on?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.280
I can wash my clothes.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.920
It's convenient.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.880
Do you want to try?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.640
That won't be necessary.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.760
Forget it.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.960
That's interesting.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.800
Who are you?

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.940
(Emperor of Great Liang)

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.440
Greetings

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.250
(Song Lingxiao, Heir of Marquis Xuanping)
to

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.400
Your Majesty.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.680
Get up.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.200
Everyone, step back.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.240
Aye.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.560
Come on, get up.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.760
It's been years.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.480
Let me take a good look at you, Nephew.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.280
You've really grown up.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.280
By the way,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.600
is your mother doing well in Jiangnan?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.200
Thanks for your concern.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.280
She is doing well.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.470
Before I set out,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.440
she told me

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.000
to convey her greetings to you.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.480
May you enjoy good health.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.720
I am doing well.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.000
Lingxiao,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.920
as stated in the letter,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.960
in recent years,
many of my children have died young.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.120
I've been investigating it,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.760
only to find it somehow

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.480
related to the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.800
My mother and my queen
live in the inner palace,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.120
with their every move under close watch.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.920
If they were to investigate this,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.720
it'd surely alert the enemy.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.160
I've been thinking about it.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.360
You are the most suitable person
for this matter.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.440
Although you do not know medicine,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.960
you are exceptionally smart.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.840
If you infiltrate the bureau in disguise,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.000
you'll surely uncover some clues.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.320
Please rest assured.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.280
I will spare no effort

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.720
to uncover the truth.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.360
Remember,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.280
you must be extremely cautious.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640
If you find anything,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.320
you may report to me at any time.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.640
Do not let your guard down.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.020
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.920
Hurry up and make the beds.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.000
Do you know how to make a bed?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.400
Hurry up!

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.000
Open the door.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.440
What are you doing?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.920
What are you doing?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040
Open the door.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.120
Oh, Attendant Rong,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.480
the door seems to be broken.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.240
Just find somewhere outside
to sleep tonight.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.440
Yes.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.600
This door just won't open.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.440
I'll find someone to fix it tomorrow.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.320
Now it's really broken.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960
Screw you.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.840
Get off me!

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.880
It hurts! What are you doing?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.360
- Attendant Rong!
- Get off me!

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.600
We live under the same roof.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.360
Please don't go too far.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.880
Feng Yin, have you got
nothing to do with this?

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.320
- Stop playing innocent!
- Stop!

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.440
Come out!

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.520
What are you going to do?

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.770
Get off me!

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.600
Get off me!

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.720
What are you going to do?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.200
Rong Zelan!

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.000
Stop it right now!

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.880
All of you, shut up!

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.270
One more word,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.400
and I'll throw her down!

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.600
Don't you dare!

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.640
If I die,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.480
my family will not let you off!

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.800
Do you think I'm scared?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.560
No one can save you.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.520
Attendant Rong,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.920
don't cross the line.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.440
If she dies,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.040
your family will be implicated.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.560
I would love to see

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.840
that happen.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.970
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.400
I'm so sorry!

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.640
Attendant Rong, please

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.560
spare me!

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.720
I won't do it again!

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.080
You provoked me.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.640
Do you think I'll let you off so easily?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.400
Attendant Rong, I'm sorry!

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.200
Please spare me!

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.240
I'm really sorry!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.000
I'll never do it again!

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.080
Please spare me!

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.760
I'm begging you!

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.400
I'm begging you!

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.520
I'm stubborn by nature

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.720
and as fierce as fire.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.360
I'm not a troublemaker,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.960
but never a coward.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.360
I came here to study medicine.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.240
I'm not going to waste my time on you.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.680
Today, I will make myself clear.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.640
From now on, let's stay out of
each other's way.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.840
If anyone dares to provoke me again,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.600
they will end up like her.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.760
(Rong Zelan,)

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.440
(how dare you be so arrogant?)

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.400
(Do you think I have no way
to deal with you?)

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.440
(Imperial Medical Bureau)
Today, Lord Feng will assign us tasks.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.520
I hope to get a good post.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.480
Let me introduce him.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.520
This is Song Lingxiao, a new

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.640
medical officer.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.480
Greetings, Lord Song.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.380
Today,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.600
I will assign you

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.400
your routine tasks.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.760
Keep in mind

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.560
that we bear great responsibilities.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.560
You must not slack off.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.160
Aye.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.480
Feng Yin,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.080
go to the Imperial Pharmacy

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.560
to assist second-class attendants

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.640
in managing and organizing
medicinal materials.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.360
Yes.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.160
Attendant Feng,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.200
I really envy you.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.520
Though a newcomer,

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.640
you can go to the Imperial Pharmacy
to oversee valuable herbs.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.680
You'll certainly achieve great things.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.480
Attendant Feng, when you succeed,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.640
don't forget about us.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.160
Chen Hongyu,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.120
Rong Zelan,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.200
Su Ye,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.120
and Liu Qinghe,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.800
you're responsible for
cleaning the courtyard.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.320
(If it's only cleaning the courtyard,)

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.520
(when will I be promoted to
second-class attendant?)

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.920
Minister Feng,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.720
I'm also skilled at identifying herbs.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.320
Is there a chance for me
to work at the Imperial Pharmacy?

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.910
Some people

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.040
just don't know their place,

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.840
even thinking about being
on equal footing with Attendant Feng.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.280
What a joke.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.200
Rong Zelan,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.080
have you no manners?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.160
You'll do whatever I tell you to do!

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.280
This is not somewhere
you can pick and choose.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.280
Minister, you're right.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.480
However, I still have a doubt.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.440
Could you please enlighten me?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.560
Say it.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.200
As the old saying goes,
fine birds choose trees,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.720
and great healers choose positions.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.440
Does the bureau select talents

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.240
by virtue and ability?

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.880
Yes. So what?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.310
Attendant Feng made a misjudgment

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.360
about the Cistanche.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.040
Fortunately, I corrected it in time

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.120
and avoided misuse of herbs.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.040
Minister, could you please

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.760
judge clearly about my ability?

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.680
As the vice minister,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.400
Lord Feng has his principles.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.720
Rong Zelan,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.840
are you

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.720
questioning Lord Feng?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.680
I wouldn't dare.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.320
I'm abiding by the rules
and rectifying the canon of medicine

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.680
by discerning the false
and preserving the true.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.840
If I were to remain silent
about a misjudgment,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.960
it'd place you in an unjust position.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.840
Minister Feng is an imperial official.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.160
He certainly abides by the law and codes.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.480
I really admire you

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.840
for your ability to identify herbs.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.480
There's always something
one can learn from others.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.920
If we both work at the Imperial Pharmacy,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.920
we'll learn from each other,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.720
and it'll demonstrate
Minister Feng's wisdom in using people.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.040
I can wait until
the three-month term is over,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.120
after which the ministers may personally

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.480
examine us and let the best one stay.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.000
Okay.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.320
In that case,

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.520
you two will both identify herbs
in the Imperial Pharmacy.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.720
If anything goes wrong,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.200
you'll both be severely punished!

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.360
Yes.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.600
Thank you, Minister Feng.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.160
Thank you, Attendant Feng.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.120
I'm looking forward to

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.360
working with you.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.840
(Enjoy your good days while you can,)

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.040
(because soon,)

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.720
(I will make sure you have no place)

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.720
(in the Imperial Medical Bureau anymore.)

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.480
I didn't expect to find
Manure-prepared Licorice

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.440
in the latrine.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.120
What a surprise.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.160
You're not only good at hitting people

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.560
but also sharp-tongued.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120
You even made

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.320
Lord Feng speechless.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.880
Sorry that I underestimated you.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.120
Lord Song, I'm so flattered.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.960
What is this?

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.400
Why does it stink so much?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.320
Take it away!

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.720
This is Manure-prepared Licorice.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.520
Place Licorice in bamboo tubes
and bury them in the latrine.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.400
The smell is rather unpleasant,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.400
but it's perfect
for cooling and detoxifying.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.840
As a medical officer,
how could you not know?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.600
That is really weird.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.080
Hmph.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.280
Manure-prepared Licorice,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.800
I certainly know.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.800
I was just testing you.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.800
After all, you once sneaked into
the Men's Bathhouse

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.920
in disguise.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.360
Who knows if you're up to something?

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.680
Lord Song, you are overthinking.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.160
I'm a new medical attendant
in the palace.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.080
I got in after multiple rounds of
reviews and examinations,

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.920
with a clear background.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.040
However, My Lord,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.880
as a medical officer,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.920
you can do martial arts,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.440
and your medical skills

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.040
are still unclear.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.760
The reason you entered
the Imperial Medical Bureau

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.520
really puzzles me.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.400
Attendant Rong, here's

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.720
a piece of advice.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.360
Too much curiosity

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.240
might get you into trouble.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.880
You only need to know one thing.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.840
I mean no harm to the bureau.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.120
Yes, My Lord.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.320
Attendant Rong,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240
I can sense

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.320
a dangerous aura on you.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.960
You'd better

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.240
hide yourself well.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.040
If I catch you one day,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.480
your life will be at risk.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.880
Same advice for you.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.400
After all, I'm not some
meek lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.440
That's good to know.
