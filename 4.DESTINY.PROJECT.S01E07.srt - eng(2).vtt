Hey!

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.430
Hey!

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.950
Get up!

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880
Punching like that's just gonna hurt your hand for nothing.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.440
No one's as good as you!

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.400
You keep talking nonsense.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.430
Come on.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.030
One-two?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.390
Yeah. One-two.
Come on!

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.510
Do it properly.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.100
You punch really weak.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.050
I've brought your order.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.760
Who the heck!

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.420
Hold on, bro.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680
I'll grab it for you.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.970
Don't trouble yourself.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.390
Drop it!

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.150
Drop it!

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.550
Drop it!

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.290
Please pay up for me, bro!

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.350
What the heck?

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.810
Please make the payment.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.990
120 baht.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.230
I didn't even eat, why do I have to pay?

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.320
Come on.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:57.480
Hey.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.830
Go!

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.210
Go! Go!

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.860
Hey, don't dodge!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.810
I'm sorry.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.510
I'm not giving you the money if you dodge!

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.590
Hell yeah!

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.270
Round's over, bro!

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.630
I was really getting into gear!

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.330
Yo, little bro, how's it feel?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.170
Well.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.850
I was just getting warmed up.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.210
Hey, it's gonna sting a little, bro.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.390
I'm okay, bro.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480
Where did I put my money?

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600
Here, bro.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.710
Is there anything missing?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.130
It's complete.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.180
Thank you so much.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.290
Thank you.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.650
My wife's gonna hit me harder than this.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.550
If it weren't for you, I'd have no way to let off this steam.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
Hey, Benz.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.920
Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.200
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.896
- Thank you.
- You can use my service again.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.920
Yeah.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.030
It's hurt.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520
Hey.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.950
Don't freak out.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.950
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.790
I'm just here to talk to you.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.070
How much do you still owe?

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.490
300,000?

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040
Yes, Wao.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.880
Can I have a little more time?

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.380
Isn't it still not due yet?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.830
But my boss has a short temper.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.400
So he offered you a good solution.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
Hey.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.070
A simple task

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.580
you're familiar with.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.190
If you agree to do this job,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.940
my boss will reduce your debt by a hundred thousand.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.420
No,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.600
I'm not getting involved in this stuff anymore.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.090
Oh, you bastard.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.110
Suddenly you wanna be a good person, huh?

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.560
An easy job with a hundred thousand grand,

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.780
do you want the easy money,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.820
or will you have to take a million punches to pay off your debt?

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.610
I guess

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.070
you'll have to take punches until your next life.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.250
It's definitely like that.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.740
Oh, boss. Hello.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.690
Hey, jerk, grab him!

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.840
Where ya going?

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.550
Grab him.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.770
You make me tired.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040
Damn it.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.860
Damn.

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:07.893
Fuck.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.950
Hey, stop.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.070
This bastard is ridiculously tough!

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.060
Let me check his bag.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.410
Wow, you're so hardworking.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.990
Wow.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800
Hey.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.386
I'll just take this money as my earnings.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.320
H... Hey!

00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:32.480
Wao! No!

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.600
Hands off!

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.420
I beg you!

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:35.820
I said let it go, damn it.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.690
You fucking bastard,
you're really pissing me off, you ahole!

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.610
I need to pee right now.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.480
Hey, grab him!

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.510
Grab his hand.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.280
I'm gonna smash his hand to pieces. Damn.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.430
Which hand did you use just now?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.540
This side?

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.600
You're really brave with me, huh, Yim?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.810
Here's your food.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.860
What the fuck do you mean by food? I didn't order shit!

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.020
Don't move.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.240
You!

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.390
Hey!

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560
Hey, let's go.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.200
I'll make you pay, you bastard.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.910
Hey, are you okay?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360
Hey.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520
Let's go.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.460
Yim!

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.110
Yim!

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.310
Yim!

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.760
Yim!

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960
Yim!

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.230
What's going on? Why do you smell like pee?

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.510
What happened to your face? You look like you wrestled a dog.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.050
You even lost a fight with a dog.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.730
How did you know I fought with a dog?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.990
Have you ever fought a dog?

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.825
Even hurt this bad, you can still get on my nerves?

00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:50.069
Should I give you a slap?

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.070
Hey! Hey!

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.470
What are you guys fighting about!?

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.260
If you want to fight, take it to the ring.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.960
Our boss didn't bring you up to be a gangster.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.400
You're older, why are you picking fights with this kid?

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.430
Alright, go on. Let's split up and back to practicing!

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.920
Yim, follow me!

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.860
Take this before you kick the bucket.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.850
If you have any problems, just tell me.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.670
How's it going? How's your training coming along?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.290
Are you ready for tryouts?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.190
Train what?

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.220
When you're not around, there's no one to train me.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.540
Because you are like this.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.700
You are not serious.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.660
Let me see. Raise your guard.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.960
My guard?

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.480
Yeah.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.970
So chill.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.900
Because you are like this.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.940
I was just kidding, why are you so serious?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.670
Whose is this?

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.320
These things?

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.170
These are our rising star boxers' things.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.540
At that time, our gym wasn't behind anyone.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.340
Was our boxing gym had fighters that strong?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.460
Where are they now?

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.900
They've retired.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.650
What a shame.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.940
Back when our boxing gym was thriving,

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.270
I was a rising star.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.360
I used my elbows and knees like this!

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.410
No one can beat me, seriously.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440
Do you get it, Yim?

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.410
Huh?

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.470
You just leave me talking to myself?

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.740
[F.A.GROUP MUAYTHAI GYM]

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.520
Punch!

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:16.730
Punch him!

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.170
Fight him back!

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.180
What the fuck do you mean by food? I didn't order shit!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.120
Don't move.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.580
Are you okay?

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.850
Hey.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.630
Yim!

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:59.850
Yim!

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.680
Yim!

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.000
Yim, why are you spacing out?

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.530
Go! You're up next. Get in the ring!

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.840
Keep your guard up!

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.170
Get in guard!

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.550
Don't run!

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.880
Yim! Fight him back!

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.270
Yim! Fight him!

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:47.920
Yim! Fight him back!

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.410
Yim! Fight him!

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.610
Fight him back!

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.370
Let's go.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.870
Isn't that enough to see the result?

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.460
Hey, don't rush it. This might be Yim's final round.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.000
Knock him out. Knock him out.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.400
Yim.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.510
Make sure you store everything and lock the door properly.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.380
The cut on your face has healed.
Don't mess with others again.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.250
Don't forget to grab my stuff when it comes.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.650
Go!

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.780
Why is it so stiff?

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320
It's hurt.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.160
Get into a solid stance first,

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.180
then punch the bag.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.210
Hey, I remember you.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.430
That night.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.150
Yeah, don't thank me.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.360
Who the hell would thank you?

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.520
You dumped me here,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.910
and the damn mosquitoes tore me up because of you!

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.080
Damn.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.340
If I knew you'd nag like this,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.250
I should've just ditched you there.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.660
I was just kidding.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.440
Just kidding?

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.390
I was just joking.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.870
I'm Yim.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.090
Thanks for helping me and dropping me off here.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.170
Honestly, you didn't have to help me.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.280
It was just 4-5 losers.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.890
I can handle it easily.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.790
Look at you. You don't believe me?

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.250
Huh?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.360
Fine!

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.610
Wanna duel me then?

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.190
Huh?

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.560
Wanna duel me for a round?

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.090
Come on!

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.160
Oh yeah?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960
You're dead meat!

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400
It's hurt.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:21.810
You're crazy good! (dialect)

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.480
Pardon?

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.960
Why are you that good?

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.740
You're better than a few fighters at my gym.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.570
You mean...

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.160
you?

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.090
Yeah.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.410
Thank you so much for helping me that day.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.830
If you hadn't been there, I'd be beat to hell.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.030
Yeah.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.140
Hey, wait!

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.880
Don't leave.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.020
Please teach me how to fight like that day again.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.990
Please?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040
No.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.480
Huh? Why?

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.840
Please train me.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.980
Please.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.750
No.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.140
Please train me. Please?

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.650
Please?

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.330
So what do I get for training you?

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.430
I'll give you this drink for free if you train me.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.930
Okay?

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.010
Stop!

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.520
I'm gonna drop your rating.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.360
If you don't train me, I'm gonna report you.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.590
I'm reporting you for ignoring the customer's needs.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:36.730
You...

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.310
I'll bring a ghost to scare you!

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.030
I'm gonna tell my dog to bite you too!

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.060
Do whatever you want,

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.540
I can always beat you up later.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.270
Hey, my drink!

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.240
Aren't you supposed to bring it to me!?

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.370
How can you take it!?

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.550
Won't train me, and still trying to take my drink?

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.510
But, what's his name again?

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960
I was just about to ask…

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.210
Damn.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.110
Thank you,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.690
Kampanat.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.930
My name is Yim.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.170
What is your name?

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.590
Or do you want me to call you

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:47.740
Kampanat?

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:48.810
Your real name.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.180
Stop acting like this.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.480
I'm annoyed.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.850
Stop telling other riders to call me to deliver your food.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.370
I just wanted to see you.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.320
Besides, I tipped my money to the riders.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.550
Don't worry about them.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.380
If you're so annoyed, just train me.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.050
You're not suspicious of me at all, are you?

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:15.790
Why would I be suspicious of you?

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.730
You don't seem like a bad person at all.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.220
Alright,

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.710
if you really want me to train you,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.650
then stop wasting your time on nonsense

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.880
and start taking your training seriously.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.790
After that, will you train me?

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.290
You have to start by jumping rope here.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.610
1,000 times a day.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.620
I need to see you jump rope when I ride past here again.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.050
If you don't do it,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.130
I won't train you.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.400
1,000 times?

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.170
Can't you just train me? (dialect)

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600
Say what?

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.240
Can't you just train me?

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:58.730
1,000 times.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.210
If you don't do it,

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.550
I won't train you.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.920
1,000 times...

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.820
Fine.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.350
Well, 1,000 times.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:23.850
Okay, 1,000 times.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.210
I'm getting serious!

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.900
Just jump...

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.380
Damn it.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.770
Do it properly.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.830
Do you think you can finish jumping rope like that?

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.280
My name is...

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.360
Kamphan.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.580
Kamphan?

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.390
Kamphan.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:38.970
Who are you looking for?

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040
Me?

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.480
What did I tell you?

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.100
I told you I need to see you jump rope when I ride past here, didn't I?

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.450
I just took out the trash.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.880
Are you here to learn boxing or to learn how to clean?

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.700
Hey.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.960
I have to clean the boxing gym,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.816
where am I supposed to get the money to pay off my debt?

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.840
Enough.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.050
Stop changing the subject.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.970
As we agreed.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.980
I told you I need to see you jump rope when I ride past here.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.060
What did I agree with you about?

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.310
1,000 times a day.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.180
Yesterday you jumped rope 850 times,

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.290
and today you slacked off with just 600?

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.530
If you're not gonna take this seriously,

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.620
I'm out.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.460
Hey.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.980
How did he know?

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:20.130
991, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99...!

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.140
1,000!

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.170
That's it!

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.270
If you actually try, you can make it!

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.740
I finished the jump ropes like you said.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.920
Now can you train me?

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.300
Huh?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.350
Tell me the reason why I should train you.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.220
Huh?

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.480
I've done what you told me to do. (dialect)

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.100
Say what?

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.960
I've done what you told me to do.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.900
I want to get better,

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.770
or else I'll die from being trampled one day.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.940
At least I can protect myself.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.910
I want to be able to face the boxers in the ring, and Wao.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.290
I wish I could fight them.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.940
Hey.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.920
Hey.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.910
Look at my sincere eyes.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.020
Please? Please train me.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.720
Yeah.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.180
Are you gonna starting training today?

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.900
Go back and rest for now.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.420
Let's start training tomorrow.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.980
See you on the deserted road.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
Hey, wait!

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.300
How do you know I'm slacking off when I jump rope?

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.580
YES!

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.890
Woohoo!

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.690
Where did you get these things!?

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.730
Did you come to question me or train?

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.680
Train! Train.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:23.790
Go!

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.360
Where?

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.790
Get ready!

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:26.930
Come on.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.500
Okay. I'm ready!

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.120
Are you gonna practice in that outfit?

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.830
Sorry.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.510
Hurry up. We will practice in this life.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.120
Please wait a moment.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.440
When you throw the punch,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.810
throw it straight like this.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:52.929
Okay. When you throw...

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:53.440
Okay.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.690
Bend your knees.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.650
Yeah.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.820
Snap punch.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.350
Twist your body more.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.440
Look at your opponent's face.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.660
Punch.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.700
Hold on.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.440
Can't you stop smoking?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.500
I stink.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.050
If you don't like it, just go back.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.700
It's not good for your health.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.110
My health or yours?

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.430
Your health!

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.670
Do you still want to train?

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:20.780
Yes.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.280
Go. Continue using your left hand.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280
Yeah.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.210
That's right. Maintain your balance and keep punching.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:31.910
Okay.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040
I'm exhausted.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.100
Try again.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.039
Lean forward a little more.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.040
Go further!

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.550
- Yes. More!
- Hurt. I'm hurt!

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.380
3... 2...

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.490
Who are you waiting for?

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.570
Me?

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.200
Look.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.440
Do you see them over there?

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.046
He has been waiting for you since the afternoon.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.070
Who?

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.110
Damn!

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.560
Why did Wao come here?

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:54.770
Damn.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.860
Now I can't practice.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.280
I put in so much effort to get ready today.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.810
I guess we should head back separately.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.260
Bye.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.340
Hold on.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.310
Come on, get on.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.790
Huh?

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:10.950
Where to?

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.460
I told you to get on, so get on.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:23.850
Here.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:24.890
Do I have to wear it too?

00:30:24.891 --> 00:30:26.320
Yeah, safety first.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.860
Your helmet smells weird.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.410
Let's go.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.660
Where are you taking me?

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.720
Don't you have to go to training?

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.610
Are you sitting at the front?

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.740
Sure thing.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:47.760
Let's go!

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.480
I let you ride with me all the time, why are you still so heavy?

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.700
Stop whining.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.420
- Hurry up, I want to train now.
- You blocked my key.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.820
I'm in top form today.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.270
Go!

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.180
Don't block me. Lower your head!

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.460
Yeah.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.040
Wow.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:19.290
Where are we now?

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.510
Are you ready?

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.330
Huh? Ready?

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:24.910
Why do I have to be ready?

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.426
Aren't you gonna train anymore?

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.450
Take off your jacket.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.240
Yes, I will train.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.140
But can you tell me first?

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.390
Where is this place?

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080
Alright.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:40.630
My house.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920
House?

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.250
Wow.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.930
I'm tired. Can I take a break?

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.739
Yeah, you can rest now.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.860
Here, your water.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.100
Nice.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.160
Thank you.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.600
Uh.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.056
Why is it so quiet in your house?

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.080
Who are you with?

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.020
Me?

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.080
I live alone.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.060
I don't like having a lot of people around. It's too chaotic.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.250
Alone?

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.980
What about your parents?

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.940
They're in another house over there.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.060
So I'm living here alone.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.550
So it turns out you're Young Master Kamphan.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.140
You're like a rag wrapped around crap!

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.796
You're supposed to say it's wrapped around gold.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:15.820
Just kidding.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.350
It's also yellowish. (dialect)

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.480
So they're interchangeable. (dialect)

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640
Huh?

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.340
It's also yellowish.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.760
So they're interchangeable.

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:23.970
Oh.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.160
Come to think of it,

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:29.930
your house looks pretty rich.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.440
How come you became a delivery rider?

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.340
That's on me.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.650
Can't you just butt out?

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:37.390
Wow.

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:40.430
I'm just asking a little, no need to piss off at all. (dialect)

00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:41.930
Huh?

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.760
I'm just asking a little, no need to piss off at all.

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.240
Alright.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.220
Let's just say this is my personal preference.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.519
I'll be back.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.560
I'm gonna feed the dogs.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.960
Oh, you have a dog?

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.900
Wow...

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.150
Young Master Kamphan.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.040
Such a warm-hearted guy.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.960
I'll be back.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:06.940
Hey, wait.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.530
Can I play with your dog too?

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.620
I don't care, I'll go anyway.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640
Wait for me!

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.059
Gimme your paw.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.200
Other paw! Good girl.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.940
You're adorable!

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.110
What's your name?

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.670
Hmm? What's your name?

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.900
Khai Jiao.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:31.890
Who asked you?

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.540
I'm asking this little dog.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:34.550
Right? Khai Jiao.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.300
Just kidding.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.820
Khai Jiao. Khai Jiao. Khai Jiao.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.150
Paw!

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.200
Just go back to practicing.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.140
What?

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.140
Can't I play with the dog first?

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.780
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.450
Can I play with her first?

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.130
Please?

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:58.940
Well.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:59.980
Okay.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.040
Khai Jiao. Paw!

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.460
Other paw!

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:10.000
Other paw.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.050
Give her some snacks too.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200
Are there snacks too?

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.760
Here. Khai Jiao.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.660
Not me!

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.630
Oh, wrong one.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.490
Gimme your paw!

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960
Good.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.440
Nom-nom-nom.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:28.970
Up!

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.940
Let's use the ‘up' command.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.160
Good girl. Khai Jiao.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.020
Why do I have this sharp pain?

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.760
What's wrong?

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.610
- I don't know.
- Let me check it.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.050
Come on. I'll give you a massage.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120
Move over here.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:54.910
I'll do the massage for you.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.120
Could it be a muscle spasm?

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.140
I don't know.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.030
Suddenly, it gave a sharp pain.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.580
Yeah, right there!

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.960
Great! Great! Great!

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.050
Great!

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.450
Great. Great.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.620
Exactly there.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.640
You're so clever.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.790
Aren't you going to continue training?

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.210
Hey, my arm hurts.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:27.860
I have a sharp pain.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:28.946
Please continue massaging me.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:29.970
Please. Please. Please.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.540
Fine.
